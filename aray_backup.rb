 => [[41, "Bibliocloud's golden rules", "<p>There are certain principles that we have built Bibliocloud around, which, if stuck to, make for an easier life all round. The Golden Rules are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Enter data once, and once only. (You can edit data, of course, but you shouldn’t enter a review twice, or upload a cover twice. Enter it once, and link it to other records.)</li>\r\n<li>Type amendments to data directly into the system as they arise – don’t annotate printed reports or downloaded spreadsheets. It’s safe to assume that you’ll never get around to typing them in.</li>\r\n<li>Enter as much data about a title as early as possible, before the decision to publish has happened.</li>\r\n</ul>"], [45, "Search tools", "<p>There are a number of ways to search for records in Bibliocloud:</p>\r\n\r\n<h4> Product quick search</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a search bar at the top of every page, on the black header bar, which lets you search by product, ISBN or author. It will always return a list of matching products. (This search bar disappears on narrow browser windows if there isn’t room for it.)</p>\r\n\r\n<h4> Local quick search</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>If you go to one of the list pages (such as the Contract search), you’ll see an additional search bar next to the always-present product quick-search bar. In this example, the additional search bar will say ‘Search contracts’.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Advanced search</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>An Advanced search option is available on the following list pages:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Titles</li>\r\n<li>Products</li>\r\n<li>Contracts</li>\r\n<li>Rights</li>\r\n<li>Address Book</li>\r\n<li>Production runs</li>\r\n<li>Schedules</li>\r\n<li>Tasks</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You can use the fields to refine your search. Click on the Advanced search button to reveal the fields that you can use. Click the green ‘search’ button to run the search query. Click the red ‘reset’ button at the bottom of the form to remove all the search options and start again.</p>\r\n"], [86, "Add new work", "<p>You can add a new work, and any number of products that belong to it, through filling in one form. Click on 'Add new' from the Main menu, at Main menu > Publishing > Products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The intention here is to add as much information as we can before we’ve even made a decision about whether or not to publish this title. If we have a lot of information, we’ll be in a good position to make as sound a publishing decision as possible. Then, if we do decide to go ahead, we won’t have to type in a lot of data – the hard work will already be done (and will have been done when our enthusiasm was arguably at its highest). Bibliocloud doesn’t make adding lots of information an onerous task because it uses templates and shares information so you only have to enter it once.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click on Main menu > Publishing > Products > Add new. You may be asked to follow some instructions to get the drop down lists set up – such as title and product templates. Once everything that you need to continue is in place, you’ll see a form.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Title</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The first field asks you to enter the title. This title will be used for all the products of the title. If one of your products has a different title to the others, you can edit it later by going to its metadata page. This one-page form is intended to be a quick way to get the bulk of the title and its products set up in one go – any nuances like this can be corrected afterwards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The system will notice when the title contains a prefix such as ‘A’, ‘An’ or ‘The’ and will split out the title into two separate fields when you hit ‘Save’. The ‘Title prefix’ field will eventually contain any words such as ‘A’, ‘An’, ‘The’. The ‘Title’ field will contain the rest of the title. So, if you were entering ‘The Hobbit’, you’ll see ‘The’ in the title prefix field and ‘Hobbit’ in the title field. This will make it easier to sort your records later on, and help to make your data ONIX compliant.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Shared Metadata</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Bibliocloud stores common data at the title level, such as subjects, marketing texts and contributors. It means you don’t have to store the same data for each of the products, which can cause confusion, extra work and inaccuracy. (You can optionally stop any of the individual products from using that data, by unticking the checkbox on the Metadata edit page, later.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can add shared metadata field-by-field, or you can use a template.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To enter shared metadata field-by-field, select ‘Fill in detailed metadata fields’ from the drop down menu, and some fields will appear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Category field is your own in-house classification scheme which you can set up in addition to BIC and BISAC codes. Click on the label ‘Category’ next to the field, or follow Main menu > Settings > ...for titles > Categories > Add new to set up your own categorisation scheme. Categories get used in catalogues, AIs, website feeds and other company information and are a way to really tailor the way you describe your products outside of the constraints of the industry standards. Look in Settings to see how you can associate BIC and BISAC codes with your category. If you do that, you can leave the next two fields blank. If you don’t, you’d best fill in the BIC and BISAC code fields which follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There’s no complete mapping between BIC and BISAC because the schemes are very different, so you’ll have to choose the subjects you feel most appropriate from both classification schemes. Choose the BIC and BISAC codes which best represent your title – you can add further ones later to flesh out your title records and make them as discoverable as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That’s how you fill in the shared metadata manually. If you want to use a template instead of filling in those fields, select ‘Use a title template’ from the drop down list and then select one from the next drop-down list. If there’s nothing in that drop-down or if you want to add a template that doesn’t currently exist, click on the label ‘Template’ next to the field and then ‘Add new’.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Author</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You can choose to select the name of an existing author, or add another one. In this set-up form you can only add a first name and a last name. If your author has a more complex name, for example Pope John Paul II, you can edit the record later on.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Live or proposed</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Bibliocloud sets the status of a title based on whether or not the contract has been signed. If the contract is signed, then we know the title’s moving towards publication and we’ve committed to it, so we describe it as Live. If the contract is not signed, we describe it as a Proposal. Check the box if the contract is signed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Set up a project?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Choose one of your schedule templates from the list, if you want the system to set up a project and a schedule for you behind the scenes. Once the title is created you’ll find the newly-created project and schedule under Workflow > Schedules, on the title’s edit page.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Marketing texts</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You can enter basic sales information here: the blurb and the selling points. You can add HTML formatting and other more nuanced marketing texts such as reviews, endorsements, positioning statements and so on later on, on the title’s edit page.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Product Metadata</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Up until now, we’ve been adding data at title level. This next section moves us on to the individual product level.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Template</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like with the shared metadata, you can select a product template to blanket-bomb your new product record with information. This time the template is at the product level. If you want to add a new product template, click on ‘Edit’ underneath the column heading ‘Template’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next you’ll be able to select the correct format from a drop down list. For instance, if you’re on the Hardback product line, you’ll have a dropdown to select from whatever your in-house format descriptions are – something like Demy, B format and Royal, perhaps, but it’s up to you. Set them by clicking on ‘Edit’ underneath ‘Description’ at the top of the Products section.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>ISBN</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>For the ISBN you probably want to use ‘placeholder’. This is a special value in Bibliocloud that can be held by multiple records, unlike a real ISBN which can only be allocated to a single product and which therefore cannot be reused. Unless you are sure that this product is going to be published, or it has already been published and you are back-filling Bibliocloud with its details, ‘placeholder’ is the safest choice for now. Bibliocloud will remind you later to allocate a proper ISBN.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Pub date</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Select from the drop down date picker.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Est. pages</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Est. stands for estimated. Enter what you think the page extent will be.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Sales rights</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Select from the drop down date picker. Click ‘Edit’ at the top of the column to add more options to the dropdown list.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Prices</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Although product prices can be complex to fully specify, you can add multiple prices with sensible defaults by simply typing in a string of individual prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each price should consist of a currency code, such as ‘GBP’ or ‘AUD’, followed by a number. You can specify multiple prices by separating them with commas The system is fairly forgiving of the format of the number and currency code, allowing you to specify ‘gbp 7’, or ‘USD3.56’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For prices specified in GBP the system will create an ‘RRP exc. tax’ price that includes VAT at the correct rate for print or eBooks, and for all other currencies it will create an ‘RRP exc. tax’ price.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The default price for the product will be the first price specified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Territories for which the price is applicable will be inferred from the currency code, by using a country code equal to the first two characters of the currency. For Euro-denominated prices the system will enter the list of Eurozone countries (currently AD, AT, BE, CY, DE, EE, ES, FI, FR, GR, IE, IT, LU, LV, MC, ME, MT, NL, PT, SI, SK, SM and VA).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hit ‘save’ and the title, a blank contract, a schedule (if you wanted one), a new author (unless you selected an existing one) and the products you’ve specified will be created. Click on Main menu > Publishing > Products > Recently added to see your recently-added records.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Backlist titles</h5>\r\n<p>If you’re adding in a backlist title, the process is the same. Go to the new title page and fill it in. The only difference will be that you’ll already know the ISBN13.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Duplicate an existing product</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Navigate to the title you want to duplicate. Click on Data Management > Tools > Duplicate products and choose the product you want to duplicate. The system will duplicate the product in the background, making it a sister of the original product. The associated records that will be duplicated as well as all the directly associated fields such as title, subtitle and so on are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>extents, product codes, measurements, rights, series</p>\r\n<p> ISBN13s will not be duplicated. Instead the new duplicated record will have an ISBN called &lsquo;Duplicated Record&rsquo;. You can change it in Product metadata > Advanced. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>All the code that duplicates information runs in the background so your browser doesn&rsquo;t time out. So if you don&rsquo;t see your new product straight away, wait a few seconds and refresh the page.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Doing more with ISBNs</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you’ve already got a title recorded in the system, with at least one actual product such as the paperback or the hardback, the best way to add another product is to duplicate an existing one, then change any information that needs to be changed. To do that, navigate to the title you want to duplicate. Click on Data Management > Tools > Duplicate products and choose the product you want to duplicate. The system will duplicate the product in the background, making it a sister of the original product. Here are the associated records that will be duplicated as well as all the directly associated fields such as title, subtitle and so on:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>extents</li>\r\n<li>product codes</li>\r\n<li>measurements</li>\r\n<li>rights</li>\r\n<li>series</li>\r\n<li>ISBN13s will not be duplicated. Instead the new duplicated record will have an ISBN called ‘Duplicated Record’. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>All the code that duplicates information runs in the background so your browser doesn’t time out. So if you don’t see your new product straight away, wait a few seconds and refresh the page.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5> Update an ISBN</h5>\r\n<p>If you used a placeholder ISBN, you’ll likely want to update that to a real one as soon as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Go to the product’s edit page, which you can find under Product Metadata > [the name of the product] > Basics. There’s a section called Identifying Codes. Select the ISBN you want from the drop down list labelled ISBN13. If there’s nothing in the drop down list, it’s because you haven’t imported your unused ISBN13s that Nielsen sold you. \r\n\r\n<h5>Assigning an ISBN to the ebook</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Don’t think of this as adding an ISBN13: think of it as setting up a new product that is a sister of the print editions. It’ll share a lot of the same data as its print sisters. The best way to add the ebook is to duplicate an existing product. Then you can update its ISBN field.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Manually assigning an ISBN to a backlist product</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have allocated a placeholder ISBN to a product, or you want to manually type it in for some reason, there are two ways to do it. The best is to go to the ISBN13 area (Main menu > Settings > ...for titles > ISBN13s) and paste the ISBN13 into the box, adding the correct imprint. Then go to the product’s edit page, and select the ISBN from the drop down menu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to actually type the ISBN13 in, which we strongly discourage because it’s an excellent way to introduce errors, then go to the Advanced edit area for the title. In Publication Details there is a danger zone marked out in red, where you can type the ISBN.\r\n</p>\r\n"], [22, "10 uses for collections", "<h4>1) Create a quick catalogue</h4>\r\n<p>Create a catalogue of a collection’s contents in a single click in PDF format. You can add in some text for the cover and introductory pages by creating a catalogue template. </p>\r\n<h4>2) Export XML for an InDesign catalogue </h4>\r\n<p>If a PDF export is too inflexible for you, you can export an XML file containing your book’s data ready for import into an InDesign template. This means you can tinker with the layout until it’s just right. </p>\r\n<h4>3) Print your forward list</h4>\r\n<p>You can export an A3-sized PDF of your collection by clicking on the icon at the top of the left hand nav bar. Handy for those meetings when you just need a big bit of paper printed out. </p>\r\n<h4>4) Retrieve your collection</h4>\r\n<p>You can search by collection on the product search page. You can alternatively bring back results that omit products in your collection, by choosing the collection in the “is not” part of the advanced search. </p>\r\n<h4>5) High level project management</h4>\r\n<p>You can have gantt-chart schedules that apply to the whole collection, rather than just one work at a time. Click on Edit to set one up from a template. Use this for managing entire seasons on one schedule. </p>\r\n<h4>6) To Dos</h4>\r\n<p>If you have a task you need to perform lots of times for each of the items in your collection, add a to-do to the collection. Then “work on this to-do list”. You can drag and drop your items between to-do stages, although to save you going back to that page, your to-dos also get listed on the tasks icon, a ‘tick in a box’, which you’ll find at the top of every screen in Bibliocloud. Work through your list, updating the status of each one as you go. This is handy for tasks such as checking email addresses for all your authors. </p>\r\n<h4>7) Goal tracking</h4>\r\n<p>You can add a season’s list to a collection, then keep your team up to date by adding notes.</p>\r\n<h4>8) Sales conference planning</h4>\r\n<p>If your team has to get everything ready for a big sales conference, use a collection to keep everything in one place. Use a schedule to plan out the tasks you need to accomplish. Add sub-collections of products, such as Lead, Backlist and Seasonal. </p>\r\n<p>Similarly, if you have an important book launch ahead, add all its products to a collection, as well as related products you’d want to feature. Use a schedule to keep everything on track. </p>\r\n<h4>9) KPI management</h4>\r\n<p>Keep on track of what you’re being measured on. Add the products that you’re responsible for to the collection, with notes to remind you of your KPIs and progress against them. Use a schedule to keep to your measurable objectives. </p>\r\n<h4>10) Export a zip file of covers</h4>\r\n<p>Export a zip file of all your covers saved in one of three ways: by work id, by title or by ISBN13. Very handy for using to add images to your InDesign catalogue, or for emailing to third parties. \r\n</p>\r\n"], [21, "10 uses for pipelines", "<p>Pipelines are a way to keep track of a lot of moving parts without having to type in much data. Here are ten ways you can use them. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>For all the examples here, you follow the same basic approach: first, create a new pipeline. Next, define its stages. Now, you can add records. Then move them between stages as events unfold. </p>\r\n<h4>1) Acquisition management</h4>\r\nIf you set up a work pipeline with stages such as Proposals, Revisit, Approved, and Rejected, you can keep track of your submissions. Call the pipeline something like “Acquisition meeting 2016-03-15”. Use the pipeline stage “Ready to propose” as your meeting agenda. Have Bibliocloud open in the acquisition meeting and click through to the P&L, editorial proposal, cover ideas, contract and all the other information you’ll need to make an informed acquisition decision. You’ll have a complete record of your acquisition process, and everyone will have visibility into upcoming titles, too. \r\n\r\n<h4>2) Rights deals: the licensor’s perspective</h4>\r\nIf you have a rights licensor who buys a lot of your rights, use pipelines to keep track of it all. Set up a rights pipeline called the name of the licensor. With stages such as Interested, Considering, Offered, Rejected and Accepted, you get an overview of all the titles they’re considering. You can map the stages to rights statuses, too.  \r\n\r\n<h4>3) Rights deals: the work’s perspective</h4>\r\nSet up a pipeline for one work, and keep track of the licensors interested with stages such as Interested, Considering, Offered, Rejected and Accepted. In this pipeline, the cards are the licensors, not the works.   \r\n\r\n<h4>4) Ideas notes</h4>\r\nInstead of post it notes, jot down rough ideas for new titles and commissions in your own pipeline. Give it stages such as Early ideas, and Proposal received.\r\n\r\n<h4>5) Special sales </h4>\r\nPipelines are so called after the traditional sales pipeline. Set up a pipeline for a work, and stages called \"Lead\", \"Prospect\", \"Closed\" or whatever reflects your pipeline process. Move contacts along the stages. \r\n\r\n<h4>6) Rights deals: the imprint perspective</h4>\r\nWant to keep a track of how all your titles are faring? Set up a pipeline called Rights, with stages Enquiry, Interest, Confirmed, and Signed. You’ll be able to add all your rights deals and have a pictorial overview.  \r\n\r\n<h4>7) Catalogue selection</h4>\r\nTo choose which titles should appear where in the catalogue, set up a work pipeline called Catalogue with stages of Lead, Frontlist, Backlist. Your team can shuffle cards around until they’re happy with it. Click the link under the cog icon to convert the pipeline into a collection of collections. \r\n\r\n<h4>8) Job candidates</h4>\r\nSet up stages in an Address Book pipeline to reflect your recruitment process, such as “Applicant”, “Shortlist”, “Invited to interview”, “Second Interview”, “Finalists”. Move contact cards between the stages as the application process advances. \r\n\r\n<h4>9) Prize entry shortlist</h4>\r\nYou can decide which of your titles you’re going to submit to a literary prize or festival call for submissions.  Set up a Work pipeline with stages such as “Eligible”, “Shortlisted”, “Final list”. You can make notes on the likelihood of winning and your reasons for wanting to submit.\r\n\r\n<h4>10) Submit books to retailers </h4>\r\nAdd stages to a works pipeline such as “Waterstones”, “Gardners” and “Bertrams” and refine the list of books you’re going to submit to them. Use the Batch Actions button to create AIs for all the works in the stage.\r\n"], [90, "Production", "<p>The production area is where you manage all the print runs, digital creation projects, co-edition printing and other product manufacturing projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can look at production on the local title menu or see a list of all production runs, their associated purchase orders, and associated invoices on the Main menu > Publishing > Production menu.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Overview</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Click on Production > Overview for a spec card of your production runs for this title, and their costs. If you&rsquo;ve not got any production runs set up yet, click &lsquo;Add a production run&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not an editable page: we will look at how to edit data when we&rsquo;re looking at the individual production runs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Cost estimates</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Click to add a new cost estimate, and you&rsquo;ll be able to specify an estimate from scales. Enter data according to the information you have to hand and if you&rsquo;ve specified printer scale information the system will calculate cost estimates from them. This section lists all scales and elements with cost components defined on them. Select the elements that you want to include in the estimate.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Production runs</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The Production Run area is split into four sections: </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>specs, </li>\r\n<li>quantities, </li>\r\n<li>costs</li> \r\n<li>and the purchase order</li>. \r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Click on Production > Production runs and select one of the runs to see:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Specs (specifications) contains information about the physical dimensions and descriptions of the product.</li>\r\n<li>Quantity and deliveries provides an interface to see what sales have been forecast, and plan the production run and delivery quantities accordingly.</li> \r\n<li>Costs estimates stores the costs of the production run. </li>\r\n<li>Purchase order and invoice is where you can review your order, and download and send the POs for the production run. You can also record the supplier&rsquo;s incoming invoice here, tying the performance of the project back to the original P&amp;L forecasts. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You can edit the data in this section. If you prefer, you can use the Work P&amp;L and the Proposal as a one-stop-shop for adding production data. It has the advantage of keeping the data in the context of the rest of the title project.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Add new</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You can duplicate a production run and this is probably the path of least resistance if you are organising a reprint. If there is no production run yet, then use this &lsquo;Add new&rsquo; link.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pop-up gives you a checkbox for each of the title&rsquo;s products. You might want to print a hardback and a paperback together, getting economies of scale on printing the paper block and then splitting the print at the binding stage. Or you might have co-editions to print on one run, changing a black plate for the language. Tick the products which you want to be included on this production run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Provide a rough delivery date. This is so that you can differentiate between this production run and a reprint in 18 months time. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be precise &ndash; it should be enough to roughly indicate which month or year the print run occurred in, for your ease of reference. You&rsquo;ll add more precise delivery dates by destination later on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click &lsquo;save&rsquo; to set up your production run.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Production runs: specs</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>This page allows you to define the physical specification of the products at a level of sufficient detail to be able to send a PO to the printer or supplier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The page contains sections in a tabular format for you to add and edit things like the cover specs, the binding, the paper stock, and any embellishments, finishes, origination and extra parts. This page is intended to be used by people familiar with book production terminology: you&rsquo;ll require an understanding of printer terms such as 4/4, spot UV, and of paper stock names. Similar but slightly less complete pop-up boxes exist for editorial people, in the Proposal page. Navigate there on the local title menu by going to Workflow > Acquisition > Proposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can duplicate this production run, which is useful when you&rsquo;re doing a reprint. Only the specs will be duplicated, not the costings. The duplication will happen in the background so you&rsquo;ll likely need to refresh the page to see the newly duplicated production run, which will appear as a new tab on this production overview page.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Production runs: quantity &amp; deliveries</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The Quantity &amp; deliveries page displays all the sales projections that team members have entered so that you can make an educated judgement on how many units to produce and deliver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first box is a summary: it aggregates Draft orders, Approved orders and Sales estimates. It also displays the current number of units to be produced and delivered. You can edit the production and delivery quantities in the next box along labelled &lsquo;By product (editable)&rsquo;. Check the box to include the product on the production run. Click on the very last underlined number in this table to edit the production quantities. The production quantity doesn&rsquo;t need to be saved, but if you check a box to include or exclude a product, you have to save the page. If you change the production quantity, the page doesn&rsquo;t refresh so you&rsquo;ll have to do that to see other numbers on the page update.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The remaining boxes on the page provide different views into the same data. There is a view by customer, and one by channel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the bottom of the page you&rsquo;ve got all the line level detail. This area has links so you can click through to edit any data. You can also click to create deliveries from sales estimates and orders, and you can click to add sales estimates, rights estimates and orders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you delete a sales estimate, any deliveries that you created from it will not be deleted. And if you delete a delivery, its parent sales estimate or sales order will not be deleted. On balance, at Bibliocloud Towers we have decided that it&rsquo;s best not to cascade delete data in this case. So remember to adjust any quantities accordingly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The shipping tab allows you to use the delivery data to go one step further and see what the overall shipping costs will be. </p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Production runs: costs summary</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You can add costs on this page. Alternatively you can add them through the Work P&amp;L. Click on the underlined numbers to edit the amounts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Work P&amp;L interface provides you with the capability to see the costs in context, to add unit costs and quantities for autocalulation, and to enter costs in non-home currencies which are then converted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This page, however, is good for comparing costs between two or more different suppliers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Production runs: scale costs</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>This is another way to add a new cost from scales.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Production runs: purchase order &amp; invoice</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>This page does three things. For each supplier who is quoting costs:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>It provides a summary of the costs and specs that you&rsquo;ve entered in the previous sections: &lsquo;Specs&rsquo;, &lsquo;Quantity &amp; deliveries&rsquo; and &lsquo;Costs estimates&rsquo;. </li> \r\n<li> You can generate a purchase order to send to your supplier </li> \r\n<li> You can record the supplier&rsquo;s invoice when it arrives.</li> \r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Click on &lsquo;Create your purchase order from existing spend authorisations&rsquo; if this project has been approved by the editorial acquisition meeting and money has been authorised to be spent on it. You&rsquo;ll be taken to the Work P&amp;L: click on &lsquo;Detail&rsquo; in the correct cost group in the Title Costs section, where you&rsquo;ll be able to reserve spend and raise an authorised PO. If this isn&rsquo;t the case, click on &lsquo;Add new unauthorised purchase order&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Production runs: more > organise</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Each of the remaining entries on the Production Run collapsible menu provides links to the individual records that they reference. For example, the &lsquo;Purchase orders placed&rsquo; link, when expanded, gives a link to each purchase order placed.

You can add some placeholder text – for example, the text type could be ‘Colours and graphics’. Remember, this is a template, so you’ll be entering generic text that can act as a prompt to team members when they’re writing the actual briefings for an actual product. So the briefing text that you enter for this template could be something like ‘[enter here your requirements and restrictions for colours e.g. No Pantone colours]’. It’s quite nice to wrap the text in square brackets because that sends a message to team members that this is placeholder text.</p>\r\n<p>If you want this briefing text to appear on all briefs for this work, check the box marked thus. Imagine you are creating five briefing templates, one called ‘Artwork’, one called ‘Typesetting’, one called ‘Proofreading’, one called ‘PR campaign’ and the last one called ‘Social media campaign’. When you set up the first one, and add a briefing text called ‘Target market’, then it’s highly likely that you’ll want each of these five briefings to include something about the target market.

If you&rsquo;re interested in how that works, the files are uploaded directly to the Amazon S3 cloud storage service which we use, not to the Bibliocloud Rails app. This means that the upload is as fast as your internet connection allows, and is not hampered by any processing or intermediary systems.

You can load large files one at a time, or many at a time. There are a few restrictions, though. Each file should only be 6mb or under in size. And the total number of files you can upload at any one time is limited. If you need to upload more files than you&rsquo;re allowed, repeat the upload process for batches of files.

However, there&rsquo;s a short cut for cover images. If they are .jpg files, and if you name them with the ISBN13 of the product, then the system will automatically match them to their product. So, for instance, the file might be called <code>9781905005123.jpg</code>.

You&rsquo;ll be taken to a page with your API key and password.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Now let&rsquo;s add your security credentials to Bibliocloud:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Open your Bibliocloud account in a second browser window (so you keep your Shopify account open in a browser, too) and navigate to <code>Main menu &gt; Data Management &gt; Data exchange &gt; Bulk exports &gt; ... to Shopify</code></li>\r\n<li>Click on &lsquo;Add your Shopify details to Bibliocloud&rsquo;</li>\r\n<li>Copy the Shopify API key and paste it into the field labelled Shopify API key</li>\r\n<li>Do the same for the password</li>\r\n<li>You don&rsquo;t need to do anything with the &lsquo;Shared secret&rsquo; code.</li>\r\n<li>Enter the shop name in lower case. If it has spaces, enter a hyphen instead e.g. if your store is called Bobcat Books, enter bobcat-books into the field in Bibliocloud.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If you need to return to this page at all, get to it via <code>Main menu &gt; Settings &gt; All &gt; Company information (at the top)</code></p>\r\n<p>Navigate back to <code>Main menu &gt; Data Management &gt; Data exchange &gt; Bulk exports &gt; ...of products &gt; ... to Shopify</code> and you&rsquo;ll see that you can start to select products ready to publish to your new shop.</p>\r\n<p>Click &lsquo;Run shop product selector&rsquo;. Then click on the Products tab. The products on the left hand side will be published on your live web shop. Go through the list, and if you want to remove any products, click &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; in the &lsquo;Include on Web?&rsquo; column.It&rsquo;ll change to &lsquo;No&rsquo;. You don&rsquo;t have to click &lsquo;save&rsquo; &ndash; any products you change on the right will be added to the column on the left the next time you click &lsquo;Run shop product selector&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p>If there are any problems in saving the product, a message will flash up. Click the blue product description link to edit it.</p>\r\n<div class=\"bs-callout bs-callout-info\"><h4>TROUBLESHOOTING</h4>\r\n<p class=\"noindent\">Missing products? As well as being set to &lsquo;include on web&rsquo;, they need to have a publishing status of anything that isn&rsquo;t &lsquo;cancelled&rsquo;. Leaving the publishing status blank will mean it&rsquo;s excluded from this list.</p></div>\r\n<p>Once you&rsquo;re happy with your selection, click &lsquo;Update your actual shop&rsquo;. Go to your Shopify store and click on the preview icon, which is at the bottom of the left hand nav bar. You&rsquo;ll see your data present and correct.</p>\r\n<p>You can change the look and feel of your Shopify store by browsing their Theme store. Many of the themes are free. If you want to tailor the design of a theme, have your own theme created, or have particular data from Bibliocloud appear in a particular place, General Products can do that for you as an optional extra. Contact us to discuss details and pricing.</p>\r\n<h4>TO API</h4>\r\n<p>Bibliocloud has its own lightweight JSON APIs for those who do not wish to use the more weighty ONIX 2.1 XML. Use this option to refine the products which should be included in your API feed. Contact us to talk about configuring OAuth to talk to Bibliocloud as a source of this JSON data.</p>\r\n<p>This guide is for developers who wish to ingest data from a Bibliocloud implementation for use in your own applications. You will need access to a Bibliocloud account. Please contact us to apply for a developer account if you do not currently work with any Bibliocloud users.</p>\r\n<p>The API is currently at version 4. We plan to release a version 5 of the Product API and so we are actively seeking feedback on version 4. Please do get in touch with your comments on using the API, in terms of both its structure and content.</p>\r\n<p>Version 4 of the API is currently used in production to populate http://snowbooks.com, a Rails 4 app which uses the Spree ecommerce engine. If you would like to see an example of the code which parses the Bibliocloud Products API for use with the Spree architecture, please get in touch.</p>\r\n<p>The Products API access is over HTTPS and accessed from https://bibliocloud.com/products.json. JSON and XML formats are supported. Clients can authenticate apps using OAuth 2.0, by registering your app at Settings &gt; Import &amp; Export &gt; OAuth client registration.</p>\r\n<p>With the current version of the API, the &ldquo;GET&rdquo; HTTP verb is used to access data on an existing resource. &ldquo;POST&rdquo;, &ldquo;PUT&rdquo; and &ldquo;DELETE&rdquo; are not currently supported.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Pagination</strong></p>\r\n<p>API requests that returns multiple items will be paginated (default to 35 items per page). A client can retrieve a specific page by providing the page param. A client cannot currently alter the number of records returned per page.</p>\r\n<p><strong>GET https://bibliocloud.com/products.json?api_version=4&amp;page=3</strong></p>\r\n<p>List all

Select the &lsquo; code from the drop down list labelled &lsquo;Primary &lsquo; code&rsquo;. When you save, this does three things for you in the background:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>adds an Audience code, set to 03: Young Adult</li>\r\n<li>adds a PA children&rsquo;s audience code, e.g. 11+</li>\r\n<li>adds an &lsquo; like the below with a qualifier of code 16 (interest age in months), 17 (age in years) or 18 (interest level in years).</li>\r\n<li>adds an Other Schemes record, something like the attached, with the code selected from the BIC Qualifiers e.g. 5AL is interest age from 10 years</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>You can see these fields in the Additional Subjects box on the same page.</p>\r\n<p>After the system has set these up for you, you can amend the details, if you want to.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.publishers.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=256&amp;Itemid=413\" target=\"_blank\">[link] PA notes about Age Guidance</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bic.org.uk/files/pdfs/100514%20onix%20data%20elements%20for%20release%202.n.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">[link] BIC Mandatory elements</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h4>CATEGORIES</h4>\r\n<p>If you want to add an option to the subject list drop down, which you need when you&rsquo;re editing your titles, you&rsquo;re in the right place. Go to <code>Main menu &gt; Settings &gt; ...for titles &gt; Categories &gt; Add new</code>. You&rsquo;ll get a blank form come up which you can fill in to create a new category.</p>\r\n<p>If you have a short code for the category e.g. F (for Fiction), enter it in the shorthand code field. Write the name of the category in &lsquo;Category name&rsquo;, e.g. Fiction.</p>\r\n<p>The next two fields let you also associate BIC and BISAC codes with your in-house categories. If you choose an option from the Primary BIC and/or the Primary BISAC code drop downs, then if you add this category to a title later on, Bibliocloud will automatically fill in the BIC and BISAC codes for you &ndash; provided you&rsquo;ve not already filled them in yourself. (Bibliocloud won&rsquo;t overwrite information you&rsquo;ve already added, but if your in-house category knows what BIC and BISAC codes it&rsquo;s associated with, Bibliocloud will add them if you&rsquo;ve left the fields blank on your title record.)</p>\r\n<p>You can add a parent category. This is helpful if you&rsquo;ve commissioned a Shopify store from us which has a multi-tiered subject classification scheme.</p>\r\n<p>Be sure to click &lsquo;save&rsquo; to store your new category code in Bibliocloud.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>EDITIONS</h4>\r\n<p>Click on <code>Main menu &gt; Settings &gt; ... for titles &gt; Editions</code> and either use the search options to find the edition you&rsquo;re after, create a new one, or select one from the <code>Main menu</code>. You&rsquo;ll be taken to the Editions dashboard.</p>\r\n<p>You can set up your own in-house descriptions for the formats and editions that you publish. This is so you can have a meaningful and pretty description of your products on Bibliocloud and in your catalogue, marketing materials and Advance Information sheets, as well as in the feeds that you send to your customer-facing website.</p>\r\n<p>Editions provide a friendly and meaningful description for a product. For a printed product that might be &lsquo;Mass market paperback&rsquo;, or &lsquo;Slipcase edition&rsquo;. For a digital product it might be &lsquo;Apple app&rsquo; or &lsquo;Ebook&rsquo;. These editions can have any number of formats: your slipcase editions could come in &lsquo;A format&rsquo; or &lsquo;B format&rsquo;, and your ebooks might come in &lsquo;Kindle&rsquo; or &lsquo;epub3&rsquo; format. Once you&rsquo;ve created your formats, and added an edition in this box, click &lsquo;edit&rsquo; against your newly-created edition to associate it with the right formats. You&rsquo;ll be able to add a lot more detail, too.</p>\r\n<p>When you click &lsquo;Add new&rsquo; below to create a new edition, after you hit &lsquo;save&rsquo; Bibliocloud will create a product template for your edition, and take you to the template&rsquo;s page for you to fill in. You should complete as much of it as you can &ndash; it&rsquo;s used when you create a new product so it&rsquo;ll save you a lot of time to be able to use the product template to set up a lot of basic information such as tax types and suppliers.</p>\r\n<h4>FORMATS</h4>\r\n<p>Formats are here to describe the size and shape, or electronic filetype, of your products. For a printed product, its format might be described as &lsquo;B format paperback&rsquo;. For an ebook, it might be &lsquo;Kindle&rsquo; or &lsquo;epub3&rsquo;. The description is entirely up to you, so use words that are meaningful to how you work. Set up formats first, then editions. Add the basics on this page then click &lsquo;edit&rsquo; if you want to provide a lot more detail.</p>\r\n<h4>AGE RANGES</h4>\r\n<p>You can set up age ranges here to be used on AIs, if your template uses them, and on your Shopify store, again if your theme uses them.</p>\r\n<h4>PRICE RANGES</h4>\r\n<p>You can set up price ranges here to be used on AIs, if your template uses them, and on your Shopify store, again if your theme uses them.</p>\r\n<h4>IMPRINTS</h4>\r\n<p>Edit your imprint settings at <code>Main menu &gt; Settings &gt; ...for titles &gt; Imprints</code> and click on the relevant imprint name.</p>\r\n<p>Each imprint should have a logo image uploaded, which will be used on AIs and other marketing material.</p>\r\n<p>You also supply a shorthand code, and choose the publisher to which the imprint belongs.</p>\r\n<p>You can define publically available calendars for the imprint, which allow subscribers to view the publication dates of the imprints products. The products are limited to only those with a publishing status of &lsquo;Active&rsquo; or &lsquo;Forthcoming&rsquo;, and for which the contract has been signed.</p>\r\n<p>You can upload a default image to your imprint which will be used on the AI if there is no product or contributor image.</p>\r\n<h4>ISBN13s</h4>\r\n<p>Your local ISBN agency (Nielsen in the UK, Bowker in the US) will email you an Excel spreadsheet of new ISBNs. Copy the whole column, and paste it into the box. Then the system will automatically allocate ISBNs to new products.</p>\r\n<h4>MARKETING TEXT TEMPLATES</h4>\r\n<p>Add placeholders for the marketing texts that you want to appear on every new title you create. This is useful so that people are reminded to add the basics, such as the main description, selling points and promotional headline.</p>\r\n<4>OAUTH CONFIGURATION</h4>\r\n<p>If you want a third party service to use Bibliocloud&rsquo;s Products API, this is where you&rsquo;ll configure it. You&rsquo;d best contact us to configure this for you, unless you already know about OAuth.</p>\r\n<h4>PUBLISHERS</h4>\r\n<p>This is a listing of the publisher names recorded in Bibliocloud.</p>\r\n<h4>SERIES</h4>\r\n<p>This is a listing of the series names recorded in Bibliocloud. Once you&rsquo;ve added a series name here it will be available on the Metadata area of any title, for the title to be added to.</p>\r\n<p>You can move titles between series. Scroll to the bottom of any series edit page to see the options available: you can add all products to another series or remove all products from this series.</p>\r\n<h4>TITLE TEMPLATES</h4>\r\n<p>Title templates are used to blanket-bomb a new title record with data, so you don&rsquo;t have to keep typing in the same sort of information. Add a new template by going to <code>Main menu &gt; Settings &gt; ...for titles &gt; Title templates &gt; Add new</code>.</p>\r\n<p>On the form that appears, enter a template name that will make sense when you&rsquo;re selecting it from a dropdown list.</p>\r\n<p>Choose &lsquo;An entire title&rsquo; from the dropdown list, next to the question &lsquo;what is this template for?&rsquo;. Hit save and more fields will be revealed. Fill in the fields as appropriate. One of the fields is named &lsquo;Contract&rsquo;: you can select a previous contract that you&rsquo;ve set up to act as the basis for the contract of your new titles that have this template applied.</p>\r\n"], [83, "Marketing", "<h4>AIs</h4>\r\n<p>You can export AIs one at a time or in bulk from Bibliocloud, and to do that in a single click you have to set up templates first, and attach it to an imprint.</p>\r\n<p>Go to <code>Main menu &gt; Settings &gt; ... for marketing &gt; AIs &gt; Add new</code>. Fill in the information that you want to appear on your AIs. Most fields are self explanatory.</p>\r\n<p>If you have a particular AI design that you want Bibliocloud to produce, you need to send it to us first. We use the Prawn Ruby library <a href=\"https://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn\" target=\"_blank\">[link]</a> to write code that produces PDFs with a particular look and feel. We do this development work for free, but it takes a few weeks, and we&rsquo;ll discuss it as part of your implementation project.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2AU_n76Dmy1M1BvendXYUI4Y2F4OUVCQndqbnpHblV2cmFv\" target=\"_blank\">[Download]</a> a sampler of the current marketing material templates included as standard in Bibliocloud.</p>\r\n<p>If we&rsquo;ve designed an AI especially for you, we&rsquo;ll have told you the name of it, and so you can select it from the Design Name field. Otherwise, the best way to choose a design name is to have a play with the existing designs to see which one looks best with your data.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Elegant has highlighted headers and a large title font</li>\r\n<li>Plain has a small sans serif font, a modest sized cover image and a lot of white space</li>\r\n<li>Landscape is oriented to landscape</li>\r\n<li>Keyline has a bold curved-corner line around the page</li>\r\n<li>Basic is a pleasing design with a nicely-aligned metadata box</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>BRIEFINGS</h4>\r\n<p>You can configure Bibliocloud to automatically create briefing notes from templates, when a product is created.</p>\r\n<p>To set up a briefing template, click <code>Main menu &gt; Settings &gt; ... for marketing &gt; Briefings &gt; Add new</code>. Give the new briefing template a name, such as &lsquo;Cover artwork&rsquo;. Click the button to &lsquo;Add briefing text&rsquo;. You can add some placeholder text &ndash; for example, the text type could be &lsquo;Colours and graphics&rsquo;. Remember, this is a template, so you&rsquo;ll be entering generic text that can act as a prompt to team members when they&rsquo;re writing the actual briefings for an actual product. So the briefing text that you enter for this template could be something like &lsquo;[enter here your requirements and restrictions for colours e.g. No Pantone colours]&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s quite nice to wrap the text in square brackets because that sends a message to team members that this is placeholder text.</p>\r\n<p>If you want this briefing text to appear on all briefs for this work, check the box marked thus. Imagine you are creating five briefing templates, one called &lsquo;Artwork&rsquo;, one called &lsquo;Typesetting&rsquo;, one called &lsquo;Proofreading&rsquo;, one called &lsquo;PR campaign&rsquo; and the last one called &lsquo;Social media campaign&rsquo;. When you set up the first one, and add a briefing text called &lsquo;Target market&rsquo;, then it&rsquo;s highly likely that you&rsquo;ll want each of these five briefings to include something about the target market. So if you check the box marked &lsquo;Include on all briefs for this work&rsquo; then you won&rsquo;t have to add another four briefing texts to the other briefing templates called &lsquo;Target market&rsquo; &ndash; the first one will be added automatically to them all.</p>\r\n<p>Next time you create a new product, you&rsquo;ll see your briefing texts generated from your templates on the local title menu at <code>Workflow &gt; Briefings</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>CATALOGUES</h4>\r\n<p>You can use the batch actions functionality on the <code>Product search</code> page to generate a PDF catalogue. You can do the same from a collection.</p>\r\n<p>To generate this quick-and-dirty PDF catalogue, you have to set up a catalogue template. Click on <code>Main menu &gt; Settings &gt; ... for marketing &gt; Catalogues &gt; Add new</code>. Give the template a title, a date, a strapline and a running header. Add contact info and pages info if you want. The best thing to do is to set up a quick template, produce a PDF from a collection and then refine your text once you know how it fits on the page.</p>\r\n<p>Generating quick PDF catalogues are great for reviewing your metadata in a nicely-laid out manner, and for sharing internally.</p>\r\n<h4>MAILING LISTS</h4>\r\n<p>You can have any number of mailing lists: add them here, and add contacts to them via the contacts edit area.</p>\r\n<h4>MARKETING MATERIALS</h4>\r\n<p>You can set up marketing material templates, just like you set up AI templates. If you have a particular design requirement, let us know and we&rsquo;ll use the Prawn Ruby library <a href=\"https://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn\" target=\"_blank\">[link]</a> to create it in code.</p>\r\n"], [79, "Sales", "<p>To add a new channel, go to Main menu > Settings > ...for sales > Channels > Add new. Type the name of the channel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s important to get channels right from the start, if you intend to use Bibliocloud to run your royalties. Bibliocloud can calculate royalties at channel level (amongst other things), but only if you import your sales tagged up with the channel that they belong to. This means if you create a channel called ‘US Sales’, you need to be sure that you want to report royalties for ‘US sales’, and that you will be able to import sales from ‘US sales’. If you actually want to be able to calculate royalties at a lower level, for instance ‘US Concessions’, ‘US Trade Shows’, ‘US Author Gratis’, then firstly create those channels, but also make sure you’ll be able to import sales tagged up accordingly in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sales channels are also used to forecast estimated sales. The same principle as above applies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sales channels contain a number of defaults. It means that you can enter a small amount of information and Bibliocloud can use the defaults to construct a fairly sophisticated result. For example, when you add a sales estimate, you only need to enter the product, the channel and the forecast quantity. In parallel with the sales profiles, Bibliocloud can use the default discount and default currency to build up a monthly volume and value forecast.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bs-callout bs-callout-info\"><h4>A note on how channels work with royalty specifiers</h4>\r\n<p>If no royalty specifier is present for a sales channel then the specifier for the parent master channel is considered. If there is no specifier present for a master channel then the specifier for the product is considered. It is also possible for a specifier to inherit particular attributes from a parent, so we can modify the royalties for a particular channel in respect of, say, the base rate, while also using the same date escalator steps as defined for the product.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4>SALES MASTERCHANNELS</h4>\r\n<p>At channel level, you can record some default rates such as the average distribution rate, the sales rep rate, the average royalty rate and the default royalty basis. You must add each channel that you create to a masterchannel. For example, you might name a masterchannel &lsquo;All UK&rsquo;, and have it contain &lsquo;UK Home&rsquo;, &lsquo;UK Trade&rsquo;, &lsquo;UK Concessions&rsquo; and &lsquo;UK Gratis&rsquo;. This hierarchy matters because you&rsquo;ll pay different royalty rates for different channels.</p>\r\n<h4>ALL ABOUT CHANNELS AND MASTERCHANNELS</h4>\r\n<p class=\"noindent\">Bibliocloud assigns sales to channel, which are themselves assigned to a masterchannel. A masterchannel might be called &lsquo;EBooks&rsquo;, and it might have multiple channels assigned to it, named &lsquo;Direct EBook sales&rsquo; (sales through your own website, if that&rsquo;s something that you do), &lsquo;EPubDirect&rsquo; (sales through ePubDirect), and &lsquo;Amazon kindle&rsquo; (&hellip;).</p>\r\n<p>The royalties payable on any EBook sale might always be the same &ndash; 25%, for example. The costs associated with each sale are different though, because Amazon and ePubDirect might take a different commission, and your own website does not (or maybe does, if you had spun off your website hosting into a different company that was then charging you a commission, for example).</p>\r\n<p>So, each sales channel can have its own forecasting configuration, with respect to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Discount (e.g. 45%)</li>\r\n<li>Percentage of sales that are subject to commission. (e.g. 30%)</li>\r\n<li>Sales commission on those sales (e.g. 10%)</li>\r\n<li>Distribution charges (e.g. 12%)</li>\r\n<li>Pristine returns rate (e.g. 15%)</li>\r\n<li>Restocking fee (e,g, GBP 0.80)</li>\r\n<li>Average royalty rate: (e.g. 15%)</li>\r\n<li>Whether the royalties are usually based on net or list price.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Therefore when someone forecasts that you will sell 1,000 books with a list price of GBP 9.99 through a particular sales channel, the system can then forecast that you will then see:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Gross revenue: 1,000 x 9.99 x (1 - 45%) = GBP 5494.50</li>\r\n<li>Net sale revenue: (1 - 15%) x 5494.5 = GBP 4670.33</li>\r\n<li>Of those the commissionable sales: 30% * 4670.33 = GBP 1401.10</li>\r\n<li>The sales commission would be: 10% * GBP 1401.10 = GBP 140.11</li>\r\n<li>The distribution charges: 12% * 4670.33 = GBP 560.44</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>And so on &hellip; &hellip; until you realise that your actual profit might be nuppence-ha&rsquo;penny, of course, and that&rsquo;s before you&rsquo;ve even considered the print bill. Sorry. We do, however, provide helpful charts to show just what is making money.</p>\r\n<p>All of the above is only to do with financial forecasting: even the average royalty rates.</p>\r\n<p>When you specify actual royalty rates for a contract, you can do so for:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Any sale of a particular product (for example, an eBook), or:</li>\r\n<li>Any sale within a particular master channel (for example, &lsquo;Export sales&rsquo;), or:</li>\r\n<li>Any sale within a particular channel (&lsquo;Direct export sales&rsquo;).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Print product sales are more complex, and will depend on the sales channel. You&rsquo;re likely to need separate channels/master channels for:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>UK trade sales through your distributor (e.g. royalties 10% with discount escalator at 50%)</li>\r\n<li>Export sales through distributor (e.g. 7.5%)</li>\r\n<li>Export sales on consignment (same royalty as export sales, different forecast costs)</li>\r\n<li>Special sales / special editions (e.g. 7.5%)</li>\r\n<li>Direct sales through the website</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>RIGHTS</h4>\r\n<p>You can add &lsquo;rights&rsquo; records as a sort of shorthand code. You can add a &lsquo;rights&rsquo; record called, say &lsquo;UK and US exclusive&rsquo;, so you don&rsquo;t have to specify something like &lsquo;GB IE US CA&rsquo; every time you want to say that rights are available in the UK and the US.</p>\r\n<p>Enter a name, and select an area type, and hit &lsquo;save&rsquo;. The correct drop down list will present itself. Hold down Ctrl (PC) or Cmd (Mac) and click to select as many country or region options as you like from the list.</p>\r\n<h4>RIGHTS BUNDLES</h4>\r\n<p>You can further add shorthand bundles of rights, to help you mix and match complex rights situations without having to spell them out each time. Add a name, and click &lsquo;Add&rsquo; to reveal a set of fields. Select the sort of right you&rsquo;re wanting to store. The Sales rights type drop down list contains ONIX codes. Then select whether the right is a country or a region, and whether you want to store that the rights are included or excluded. Then, select from the drop down list labelled Right list to select your previously-defined rights list. Make sure you select a &ldquo;country&rdquo; rightlist if you&rsquo;ve specified &ldquo;Countries Included&rdquo; or &ldquo;Countries Excluded&rdquo;, and a &ldquo;region&rdquo; code if not.</p>\r\n<p>You can set up fairly complicated rights bundles using this page, which will then be available on the New Title page.</p>"], [81, "Legal", "<p>Let's remind ourselves about contracts:</p>\r\n<h4>ADD A CONTRACT</h4>\r\n<p>A blank contract record gets created automatically when you create a new title and its products. You don&rsquo;t need to do anything. The blank contract contains a name, but nothing else.</p>\r\n<h4>EDIT A CONTRACT</h4>\r\n<p>As soon as you create a new work, Bibliocloud creates a contract behind the scenes. To access it, click on <code>Agreements &gt; Contract</code> on the local menu of the relevant title. Alternatively, you can use the <code>Main menu</code> to go to <code>Publishing &gt; Contracts &gt; Search</code>, and use the search tools to find your contract.</p>\r\n<h4>PREVIEWING A CONTRACT PDF</h4>\r\n<p>To see how the contract is shaping up, click on <code>Agreements &gt; Contract &gt; Preview</code> on the local Title menu. You&rsquo;ll see your boilerplate contract text at the top, with Bibliocloud-generated schedules and royalty tables down below. You can click back to the contract to fill in any missing data. Once you&rsquo;re happy, click &lsquo;Download PDF&rsquo;. You can sign and send this contract out for signature.</p>\r\n<p>And now let's look at the settings area.</p>\r\n<h4>ADD A CONTRACT TEMPLATE</a></h4>\r\n<p>A contract template is a reusable collection of legal clauses that can be used to quickly create contracts, and encourage as much consistency as possible between your contracts whilst allowing for maximum negotiation flexibility.</p>\r\n<h4>HOW TO CREATE A CONTRACT TEMPLATE</h4>\r\n<p>First of all, you should put together the chunks of text that will form the contract template. These might be the individual contract clauses, or they might be larger bundles of text. For instance, your boilerplate contract might have prelims, then the main body of the text, then it would contain a few schedules and appendices. You might choose to put all of these into one big text chunk, or split out the sections so you can reuse them in more than one contract template.</p>\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start by creating a boilerplate contract with a main body and an appendix of territorial rights.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Go to <code>Settings &gt; ...for legal &gt; Contract templates &gt; Add new</code>.</li>\r\n<li>Type in a contract template name and click &lsquo;save&rsquo;.</li>\r\n<li>Click on &lsquo;Add new clause&rsquo; and paste the body of your contract into the text area. You can put as much or as little as you want into the field: either one clause, or the whole contract, or a sub-section.</li>\r\n<li>Provide a descriptive name so you can search by it later: for instance, &lsquo;Main boilerplate body&rsquo;. Click &lsquo;save&rsquo; and you&rsquo;ll be taken to a further editing page.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>On both pages, you can add some tags to your text. These tags embed the relevant data into your contract. So, for instance, if you edit your text to something like this:</p>\r\n<pre class=\"verbatim\">The Work entitled &lt;work_title&gt; shall be of \r\n&lt;page_count&gt; pages and &lt;word_count&gt; words and \r\nshall be delivered to the Publisher by &lt;delivery_date&gt;.</pre>\r\n<p>It will appear in the contract PDF as something like this.</p>\r\n<pre class=\"verbatim\">The Work entitled 1000 Dreams shall be of 280 pages\r\n and 65,000 words and shall be delivered to the Publisher by 01 June 2018.</pre>\r\n<p>Add another clause by clicking on <code>Add new clause</code> and pasting in, for instance, the list of territories that your contract will cover. Give it a meaningful title e.g. &lsquo;List of main territories&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p>On the contract template page, tick the clauses you&rsquo;ve created and click on &lsquo;save&rsquo;. The text will appear on the right. Drag your clauses into the correct order by clicking, holding and dragging the icon. You don&rsquo;t need to hit &lsquo;save&rsquo; to save the order - it&rsquo;s done automatically. Click on the text to edit it.</p>\r\n<p>Your template is now ready to attach to a contract, so let&rsquo;s go to the <code>Contracts</code> area and do that.</p>\r\n<h4>HOW TO ADD A CONTRACT TEMPLATE TO A CONTRACT.</h4>\r\n<p>Go to the title edit page of the title that you want to add the template to.</p>\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a field half way down the first box called &lsquo;Template name&rsquo;. Click on it and you&rsquo;ll see your recently-created template. Select it and click &lsquo;save&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p>You can also apply a contract template to a rights deal. The &lsquo;Contract template&rsquo; field is in the &lsquo;Deal&rsquo; section of a rights deal.</p>\r\n<p>Once a contract template has been used on a contract, it can&rsquo;t be amended. This is to avoid the obviously undesirable situation of the text of a contract being changed once the contract is agreed.</p>\r\n<h4>HOW TO AMEND A CONTRACT TEMPLATE</h4>\r\n<p>If you want to amend a contract template that is already in use on a signed contract, the best thing to do is duplicate it and make your amendments on the new template. There&rsquo;s no limit on how many templates you store in Bibliocloud. To duplicate a contract, click on <code>Main menu &gt; Settings &gt; ...for Legal &gt; Contract templates &gt; Search</code>. Click on &lsquo;dupe&rsquo; on the listing page. Your contract template is duplicated, ready for editing.</p>\r\n<h4>HOW TO ADD AN ERRATURM TO A CONTRACT.</h4>\r\n<p>If you have signed a contract, you don&rsquo;t want to edit it, because the recipient won&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s changed. Bibliocloud won&rsquo;t let you amend a signed contract. You can, however, add an erratum. We add errata to the contract template, since all contracts that use it will be affected. Go to the contract template in question and click on Add erratum. Add the detail in. The new erratum clause will appear at the bottom of the contract template and also on each contracts&rsquo; edit and preview page.Bibliocloud won&rsquo;t prompt you to send it to the author &ndash; that&rsquo;s an exercise left to the reader.</p>\r\n<h4>ADD A RESERVE AGAINST RETURNS</h4>\r\n<p>Avoid returned sales royalty shocks! The reserve against returns is a proportion of sales that are held back from the royalty payment process against the contingency of a significant number of returns of unsold stock from retailers.</p>\r\n<p>There are currently two ways in which the reserve can be defined.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>As a default rate against a sales channels</li>\r\n<li>As an agreed rate against a sales channel for a particular contract.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In both cases the rate can be varied by the statement number, so that the reserve for the first statement might be 24%, for the second 20%, for the third 5%, and for the fourth and subsequent statements 0%.</p>\r\n<h4>SETTING DEFAULT RESERVE RATES FOR A SALES CHANNEL</h4>\r\n<p>Select the <code>Settings &gt; for sales &gt; Channels</code>. The channel list will be presented. Select the channel for which you wish to set a return against reserve rate, and the Edit Channel page will open.</p>\r\n<p>Under the &lsquo;Default reserve against return rates&rsquo; section, click on the &lsquo;Add reserve rate&rsquo; link, and two text entry boxes appear.</p>\r\n<p>Bibliocloud allows different rates to be set from specified statement numbers onwards. To set a single rate for all statements for this channel, add a &lsquo;1&rsquo; to the first box and the required rate to the second.</p>\r\n<p>To specify further rates, click on the &lsquo;Add reserve rates&rsquo; link and repeat the entry of required values.</p>\r\n<p>You can see the specification of descending return against reserve rates.</p>\r\n<h4>CHANNEL DEFAULT RESERVE AGAINST RETURN RATES DEMO</h4>\r\n<p>In this example, the reserve against return rates for contract statements will be as follows:</p>\r\n<table class=\"table\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr class=\"top_border bottom_border\">\r\n<td class=\"left_border align_left right_border\">Statement Number</td>\r\n<td class=\"align_left right_border\">Return Against Reserve Rate</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"left_border align_left right_border\">1</td>\r\n<td class=\"align_left right_border\">25%</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"left_border align_left right_border\">2</td>\r\n<td class=\"align_left right_border\">20%</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"left_border align_left right_border\">3</td>\r\n<td class=\"align_left right_border\">10%</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td class=\"left_border align_left right_border\">4</td>\r\n<td class=\"align_left right_border\">0%</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr class=\"bottom_border\">\r\n<td class=\"left_border align_left right_border\">5 and subsequent</td>\r\n<td class=\"align_left right_border\">0%</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>Press <code>save</code>, and either return to the channel list, or press the navigation arrows to move to a different channel.</p>\r\n<p>This pattern of reducing the reserve rate serves to release previously reserved royalty amounts as the contract progresses. If a total amount of GBP500 were reserved on statement 1, GBP100 of this amount would then be released on statement 2 in addition to newly earned royalties.</p>\r\n\r\n"], [50, "Approval", "<p>Deciding whether or not to publish a title requires analysis, planning and informed judgement. Whether you’re a one-man-band or a multi-national corporation, the essence of the decision is the same: will this title fit our list and make us money? Bibliocloud helps you to make that decision by making it easy to capture and lay-out the key information you’ll need: financial, editorial and strategic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a publisher of any size, taking on a new title is an investment, and therefore to some extent a gamble. While we would never impune the gut-feeling of the experienced publisher, we offer a proposal and evaluation function to help marshal all of the facts, estimations and outright guesses that are a part of the publishing process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is intended to serve a number of functions:</p?\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>By providing a single place to store the numbers on which your decision to buy the book was based, they are available to all and to some extent ‘unloseable’. You know just where the numbers are, and you can share them easily with colleagues.</li>\r\n<li>By providing a single structure, with suitable variations where appropriate, the data from all proposals are stored, held and presented in a consistent manner, enabling a better assessment of competing proposals.</li>\r\n<li>The structure provides a reminder of all the detail that must be considered in order for a proposal to be comprehensive, with no nasty surprises later when printing or co-edition costs were perhaps found to have been accidentally excluded.</li>\r\n<li>The system provides a permanent store for the data so that at a later stage the estimations and assumptions can be measured for accuracy, and the company can institute a learning process to improve future proposal work.</li>\r\n<li>You know how much money your business will make if your sales and costs come in as you forecast. If you don’t forecast your revenues and costs, and check that the former will exceed the latter, you could be driving towards bankruptcy and not even know it.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>There are two main elements to a proposal: the words, and the numbers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>THE EDITORIAL CASE: PROPOSAL</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The proposal is the document in which the proposing editor makes the non-financial, editorial and marketing-focussed case for the publication. The intent is to gather all of this into a single document that can be circulated for comment and finally put to the editorial management team for their decision on whether to go ahead with the publication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a collection of information about the new book that includes its bare details, such as the title and subtitle, the editor who is proposing it, and the author, and marketing information. This can be saved as a PDF document for printing or distribution outside of Bibliocloud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can find the proposal page on any title, under Workflow > Acquisition > Proposal. </p>\r\n\r\n<h4>THE FINANCIAL CASE: P&L</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The P&L is rather more complex, as it collates financial data from a number of departments into a single document.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main components are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The revenue from expected and confirmed product and rights sales.</li>\r\n<li>The costs of production. Your company can define the names of the cost groups and finance codes. One possible route could be that you could include editorial origination, print origination, and actual print costs, and further costs such as estimated royalty and rights payments. Editorial origination costs could include author expenses, indexing, proofreading, artwork, and other design. Print origination costs could include DTP settings and repro. It’s all configurable according to the way your business works, at Main menu > Settings > ...for finance > Cost groups and Finance codes.</li>\r\n<li>These numbers are presented at a number of levels: the title, the products, and the sales channels. Bibliocloud also provides a forecast author statement so you can see how they’ll fare in your proposed deal.</li>\r\n<li>You can find the P&L on any title, under Workflow > Acquisitions > Work P&L. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Once you have completed the Proposal and the Work P&L and held the acquisition meeting, you’ll come to a decision about whether or not to publish the title. If it’s a green light, you click ‘Confirm contribution’ at the bottom of the Work P&L. Your forecast is used to create an immutable budget, and you can now record spend authorisations, raise purchase orders and record actual invoices. </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Change a work from \"proposal\" to \"live\"</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Most titles and products start their life in Bibliocloud as a &lsquo;Proposal&rsquo;. You sign off a book in a number of ways:</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Backlist data entry</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re entering backlist data for titles that you&rsquo;ve already published, you can tick the box on the New title &lsquo;Live or proposal?&rsquo; box. This will set the title up with a signed contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Financial sign off</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>When you&rsquo;ve decided you are going to go ahead and publish the book, you click &lsquo;Confirm contribution as [GBPx]&rsquo; on the Work P&amp;L page. This freezes your forecast as a budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Publication planning sign off</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>After your financials are signed off, you can progress to negotiate the contract with the author or agent. Once this is done and the contract is finalised, you enter a signed date in the contract. This removes the Proposal tag on the listing page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In real life, it can often be the case that we have to hurry towards publication even if the contract hasn&rsquo;t been signed. Whilst this is obviously full of danger &ndash; what if the contract can&rsquo;t be agreed? What if the agent holds you to ransom, knowing that as time passes, they have more leverage? &ndash; sometimes we just have to consider a contract signed off, even if it isn&rsquo;t. In these circumstances, you can override the contract signed date. Enter a date in the future of your choosing. You can amend the date with a rather more realistic one as soon as the contract is actually signed. All contracts with this futuristic date appear on the &lsquo;Danger: contracts live but not signed&rsquo; report.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Releasing data sign off</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>So far, we&rsquo;ve signed off a title financially, and we&rsquo;ve signed it off for publication. However, we still might not want its data to be released into the big wide world. If wrong or incomplete data gets out into the supply chain it can cause absolute havoc, because retailers often rely on their first feed of information and are unreliable when it comes to updating it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Check the validity of your data by clicking on &lsquo;Validations&rsquo; on your work. Once the &lsquo;BIC excellence&rsquo; validation report is green, the data is safe to be released into the wild. At this point you can sign it off. Click on Workflow > sign offs and tick &lsquo;approved&rsquo;. Once &lsquo;approved&rsquo;, the data will be included in ONIX feeds.

Our clients tell us that, before they found Bibliocloud, they’d been daydreaming of having their data all in one place, and their chores all automated – chores such as metadata dissemination, sales aggregation and royalty statement production. They were fearing a repeat of the last disaster – wrong data on Amazon, or late royalty statements, or stock that missed the author’s signing event – where poor data management caused embarrassment and lost sales. They wanted to grow and knew they couldn’t do it with their existing systems and processes. And they also didn’t want to have to remortgage to afford a new solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bibliocloud really comes into its own when you have a team of people who are struggling to share publishing data, and struggling to work together to get products to market efficiently. If you have duplicated title lists that you have to maintain, for instance – print-outs of a big spreadsheet, or title lists you have to maintain in a royalties system and a rights system and a metadata system – that’s a clue that you need something more integrated. If you have to fill in more than one form to get your metadata to market (PubWeb, the Waterstones grid, ebook vendor spreadsheets, Amazon forms, Apple forms) then you’ll know that there has to be a better way. If you don’t have any actual schedule to follow, helping you to keep track of the multitude of tasks that are needed to get a product to market, then you’ll appreciate Bibliocloud’s workflow management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read our ebook <a href=\"http://bibliocloudimages.s3.amazonaws.com/static/guest/BibliocloudHelp.pdf\">Who does Bibliocloud help?</a>\r\n\r\n<h4>Why should I choose Bibliocloud over [competitor]?</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Bibliocloud is a fairly new product from a fairly small (and award-winning, cash-positive and profitable) company and you might feel safer going with Big Software Supplier X.

Their only job is getting you off the phone before you can speak to someone capable of resolving your problem, because those people cost money. And you know what happens if you call at 2pm? You get the same guy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, when you send us an email, you may have to wait a few hours, but you’ll get your response from Emma Barnes and David Aldridge, every single time, and we will do our level best to fix your problem.

The following is extracted from an <a href=\"http://www.digitalbookworld.com/2015/no-computer-system-can-fix-a-broken-publisher/\">article by Emma Barnes</a>, published in Digital Book World’s Expert Publishing blog, June 2015.</p>\r\n\t\t<h6>No computer system can fix a broken publisher</h6>\r\n\t\t<p>Before we get to talking about databases, metadata management, interfaces or legacy data migration, let's close the laptops, get out a Sharpie and some Post-It notes and talk about business process.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>The point at which a publishing business starts to think about putting in place a new management system is a great time for a spring-cleaning of its processes. In fact, whether a publisher realizes it or not, the reason they think they need a system is usually because of problems with process, not data.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>Yet that bigger picture rarely gets the level of scrutiny it deserves amid the daily hurly-burly of trying to keep a thousand tasks, deliverables and projects on track.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>When publishers take the time to reflect on how they work and how well it’s working, though, they tend to arrive at more intentional and efficient ideas about their workflows and processes. That’s why we encourage all our clients to let us facilitate a day’s workshop for them. At those workshops, in the morning, we document how things work in the business, right now, using Post-It notes and a big wall.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>We talk about how a publication gets from soup to nuts. We talk about how commissioning and acquisition works, about how the business considers and approves a manuscript put forward for consideration. We document how long the business allows for a book to go through its various stages of development. We write down all the discussions that have to occur and layers of approval that have to be passed—who’s involved and what each step is for. We write down all the names of the various documents that hold data. We articulate exactly how things normally happen to get a book to market in all its formats.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>Do you know who, for instance, is in charge of writing back-cover copy in your organization? And who then signs off on it? Do you pass it by the author for approval? Or to senior editors to make sure that an imprint-level view is taken? What about series editors—do they have a say?</p>\r\n\t\t<p>What about cost sign-offs—is there a stack of invoices waiting to be approved by senior managers? Can they see the context in which they’re signing them—whether they signify an overspend or are within budget—or is it just a pile of invoices needing signatures?</p>\r\n\t\t<p>How do you handle a project’s transmittal from editorial to production? How long do you allow for proofreading? Is your in-house design team actually capable of meeting the deadlines for first and final cover drafts that editorial assumes to be reasonable?</p>\r\n\t\t<p>What’s your canonical source of metadata? How many spreadsheets get maintained by different departments and individuals that contain roughly the same data?</p>\r\n\t\t<p>And what we always discover—without exaggeration — is that there’s a lot of duplication, and a lot of assumptions about who does what, and when.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>Lunch can be a sobering affair, during which the team may reflect, with some dismay, on their working practices. Don’t confuse that with snark; I would challenge any publisher to go through this exercise and feel that their workflow resembles a finely tuned machine.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>Things pick up throughout the afternoon of our workshop, though, as it’s our chance to redesign the process for the future. The bottlenecks and duplication of data and effort that seem so obvious after our morning’s work get eliminated from the plan. We have some great, spirited discussions about who, precisely, should do what. I often see real relief from people who’ve been living with the effects of a poorly articulated process, who see simplification and clarity on the horizon for the first time in years.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>It’s an exhausting day, as you can imagine, and sometimes it’s the first of many. But in time I email the team the first draft of their own \"Publishing Manual.\" It’s a document that, after many edits, refinements and discussions, will eventually be given to every new hire—\"this is how we do things here,\" with every part of the publishing process clearly written down. Responsibilities articulated, authority made clear. The roles of departments and individuals defined in writing. Timescales (both normal and crash schedules) laid out.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>The document names meetings, and their frequency, attendees and expected outcomes. It states how the team will manage the canonical version of every sort of data, from contacts and schedules to metadata and printer estimates.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>And almost as an afterthought, the Publishing Manual contains information about how the IT system will help—where the data will be entered and maintained, where meeting minutes will be captured and actioned, how sign-offs get stored and so on.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>Because configuring a system to support a particular process is the easy part. Figuring out what the process should look like, on the other hand, is the larger problem. It’s emotionally charged, challenging, difficult and often frustrating. But it’s necessary and, ultimately, hugely beneficial for the business.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>And it’s a prerequisite for the success of any significant systems implementation.</p>\r\n\t<p>The usual agenda for this workflow workshop is:</p>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>10.00am Aims of the day (see Outcomes, below) and any questions</li>\r\n\t\t<li style=\"list-style: none; display: inline\">\r\n\t\t\t<h5>Morning: the existing company publishing process</h5>\r\n\t\t</li>\r\n\t\t<li>10.15am - 11.45am Brainstorm existing process.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Work as a group to document the current process.

In the first instance, you&rsquo;ll want to get it ready for the acquisition meeting. After sign off, you&rsquo;ll want to maintain it to ensure the numbers are up to date. The steps include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Create a work and its products.</li>\r\n<li>Add estimated sales </li>\r\n<li>Add any sales orders </li>\r\n<li>Add print component specs </li>\r\n<li>Add production costs </li>\r\n<li>Add shipping data </li>\r\n<li>Generate the PDF </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>All these steps are done from this one page in Bibliocloud, so it&rsquo;s not as awful as it sounds. Doing the P&amp;L for a work should take 5 or 10 minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you've added the new work, go to the title&rsquo;s edit page and click on Workflow > Acquisition > Work P&amp;L.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Work P&amp;L report brings together all of the financial information on which a publication decision will be based. The main information sections on this report are: revenue, title costs, variable costs, and margin / contribution.\r\n\r\n<p>The Work P&amp;L, as its name suggests, aggregates data together at the title level. (You&rsquo;ll see product level data later on.) You input revenue forecasts and costs at product, channel and specification component level. The Work P&amp;L aggregates them up so you can consider the viability of the project in the round.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are only so many ways to lay out a P&amp;L, and Bibliocloud&rsquo;s P&amp;L follows the usual convention of displaying money in, money out, then the difference between the two, which is your margin contribution. The Work P&amp;L report begins with a summary of forecast revenue. Next, it shows the forecast production costs. Take one from the other, and you get the resulting margin contribution that you expect to achieve from this publication.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Revenue</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Sales estimates are forecasts of sales, by value and volume, for a period of time through a particular sales channel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Estimates are entered at the product level. It wouldn&rsquo;t make sense for them to be at the &lsquo;title&rsquo; level, since you don&rsquo;t sell a title &ndash; it&rsquo;s not a physical product, more of a concept. Having said that, it&rsquo;s good to see the sales estimates for all the products of a work together, so you can get a sense of how well the entire title is going to sell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have a firm order for sales then that would be a Sales Order, not an estimate. If a firm order is placed after sales estimates have been entered, consider whether to reduce the estimated sales orders appropriately. The reduction in estimates would not need to exactly match the order because the estimate was, after all an estimate. Usually the period to forecast over would be for the first year after publication, but could be for longer or shorter periods. However it may become confusing to have forecasts for different durations so we advise that you standardise as early as possible on as few different durations as you can. In order that proposals make sense, the estimated sales quantities should be allowed for in the print run. A total amount of estimated sales of 10,000 physical copies would not be consistent with a print run of 5,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To add or edit the sales forecasts, click on the blue plus circle link to add one forecast. Alternatively,  click on the blue plus link to be able to add forecasts for all products, all channels.  Complete the form that pops up. Click &lsquo;save&rsquo;. (To add items to the drop down lists, go to Settings > ...for sales > Sales Profile / Returns Profile.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can add as many forecast sales as you like, by clicking again on the &lsquo;Add sales estimate&rsquo; blue plus button on the Work P&amp;L.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Add a sales profile</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>When you enter a sales estimate, you enter the number of units you think you can sell over the first five years of the product&rsquo;s life. Bibliocloud takes that single number, and then uses a sales profile to split it into monthly sales. The benefit of using sales profiles is that you only have to provide the detailed sales forecast numbers once, rather than every time you enter a sales forecast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Go to Settings > ...for sales > Sales profiles > Add new. Add a name and a description of the curve. The fields which follow are the monthly split of sales. You don&rsquo;t have to enter numbers as a percentage: they just need to be relative to one another. So if you entered 50, 10, 10, 10 10 in the first five fields, that would be the same as entering 100, 20, 20, 20, 20.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve hit &lsquo;save&rsquo;, you&rsquo;ll be able to use this sales profile when you create new sales estimates.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Add a returns profile</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>When you enter a sales estimate, you enter the number of units you think you can sell over the first five years of the product&rsquo;s life. Bibliocloud takes that single number, and then uses a returns profile to calculate what the returns will be on those sales, by month. The benefit of using returns profiles is that Bibliocloud will help you to deduct returns from your sales forecasts without you having to do anything other than selecting a returns profile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Go to Settings > ...for sales > Returns profiles > Add new. Add a name and a description of the curve. The fields which follow are the monthly split of sales. You don&rsquo;t have to enter numbers as a percentage: they just need to be relative to one another. So if you entered 0, 0, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1 in the first seven fields, that would be the same as entering 0, 0, 2.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve hit &lsquo;save&rsquo;, you&rsquo;ll be able to use this returns profile when you create new sales estimates.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve added in your sales forecasts, return to the Work P&amp;L report. Your forecast sales appear at the top as a summary. You can use the detail link to view and edit any information such as the royalty basis, the royalty rates, the price and the channel-level default rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the Work P&amp;L there is a line in the Revenue section labelled &lsquo;Rights income&rsquo;. Here&rsquo;s how to get a number to appear there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click on the blue circle plus button next to the Rights deal revenue line on the Work P&amp;L. You&rsquo;re taken to a form called &lsquo;Estimated Rights Deal&rsquo;. The title will be pre-populated for you but you will have to select the right product. This means you should have set up the co-edition already.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bs-callout bs-callout-info\">\r\n<h4>Add a co-edition deal</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Navigate to the edit page of the title you want to set up an co-edition on and ensure that your contract includes &lsquo;co-edition&rsquo; as a licensed right. To do that, look at the &lsquo;Licensed rights&rsquo; box in the contract&rsquo;s edit page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the local title menu, click on Agreements > Rights deals > Add new co-edition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read the instructions and fill in the form. Once you&rsquo;ve hit &lsquo;save&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll see your newly created record in the rights section of the menu, at Agreements > Co-editions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You now have:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A new co-edition, with the language and territory of the co-edition </li>\r\n<li>A new rights deal of type &lsquo;co-edition&rsquo; for the language and with the correct licensor </li>\r\n<li>A new sales order, containing the quantity of the co-edition to be printed which will appear on the Work P&amp;L in the Confirmed Orders </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If you want to record production specs and costings for a &lsquo;Co-edition&rsquo;, follow the same instructions as for one of your in-house products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The co-edition is a sister of any other products that belong to the same title. This means you can share data from the parent title, such as subjects, marketing texts and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Co-editions are not included in ONIX messages, because they effectively belong to another publisher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whilst co-editions share many of the same aspects of their sister products, there is an additional option to help you formalise the agreement between you and your licensee, called the Record of Specification.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>You need to provide a language and a rights type. The rights type comes from the rights you&rsquo;ve licensed in the head contract. If there is nothing in this drop down list, click on &lsquo;Edit contract&rsquo; and add a license.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click &lsquo;Add revenue&rsquo; and fill in the fields that appear. You can add more than one type of revenue. The sum of the amounts will appear on the Rights line in the Work P&amp;L page.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Costs</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Production costs include print costs, as well as production and editorial origination. Shipping, delivery and ad hoc charges also feature in this part of the report.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Finance code headings</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>When a title is created, Bibliocloud fills in some default data to help get you started. On the P&amp;L, click Add a production run in the Title costs section. (If there&rsquo;s no such button, it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;ve already created a production run, so you&rsquo;re ready to go.) You&rsquo;ll see that there are some lines in the Title costs section that include cost codes, ready for you to complete. The system adds these lines when a new title record is created, based on your finance code settings. Go to Settings > Configuration on the Main menu, scroll down to the ...for finance section and click on Finance Codes and you&rsquo;ll see what this means. The codes that will be automatically set up for you when a work is created are marked with a tick as &lsquo;Include in auto set up&rsquo;. (You can sort by clicking on the column headings.) Ask your super-administrator if you want these codes or their settings changed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Cost forecasts</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>In an ideal world, as publishers, we would forecast production costs in great detail. We&rsquo;d have a forecast of how much the binding is going to cost, how much the jacket or cover will cost, and another cost for the paper itself. The printing, the embellishments, the finishes and the delivery would all be split out so we could see exactly how much printers were charging us for each component in our print orders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In reality, however, the numbers that appear on printer estimates are at a much lower level of detail. We have to make do with whatever numbers our printers are willing to share.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bibliocloud attempts to get the best of both worlds. It lets you store the specification details of each component of a print separately, so that you can retain a lot of information about your print plans, and so that you can send those plans through to the printer on an order which contains sufficient detail for them to know what it is that you want. Then, the system lets you bundle any of these components together for the purposes of getting a price. So, for instance, if your printer insists on giving you a single price for the print, the paper, the binding and the delivery, you can add these four components to a bundle and record the printer&rsquo;s single price against it. You get to store the detail of a print&rsquo;s spec, and as much or as little costing information as is available.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h5>To add a print bundle component from scratch.</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;re going to add a new, empty, component bundle. Then we&rsquo;re going to add a component to that bundle. Then we&rsquo;re going to include the component bundle on our production run. Then we&rsquo;re going to get an estimate for the jobs in our bundle from our supplier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, then, let&rsquo;s create the new component bundle. A component bundle is the grouping of production components &ndash; ranging from editorial activities such as typesetting, to production items such as binding &ndash; that we&rsquo;ll be able to attach a single price to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the local Title menu, click on Production > [production run name ] > More > Organise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click on Add cost category at the bottom of the Production Bundle Components box. A dialogue box appears. Select the appropriate finance code. Provide some meaningful description &ndash; we&rsquo;ll put &lsquo;Index proofreading&rsquo; as the description, with a finance code of &lsquo;Editorial Origination: Proofreading&rsquo;. Hit &lsquo;save&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This has set up a component bundle, but it&rsquo;s not yet got any components in it. So now we&rsquo;re going to add a component to this component bundle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click on Specs on the local Title menu, and in the Origination row, click Add print origination item. We&rsquo;ll select the bundle we created a moment ago. Fill in the other fields meaningfully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far, you&rsquo;ve added the description of the origination service you want to buy. Next, we&rsquo;ll ensure it&rsquo;s attached to the correct production run. Then, it&rsquo;s time to add the cost itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To add the component bundle to the production run, click on Costs estimates. You&rsquo;ll see a list of all the available production component bundles against which you can allocate a cost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you wanted to add another supplier&rsquo;s costing, click Purchase Order &amp; Invoice, and the &lsquo;Add supplier estimate&rsquo; link on the top tab. But for the time being we&rsquo;ll stick with the system-generated placeholder estimate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it&rsquo;s not already ticked, tick the box next to &lsquo;Index proofreading&rsquo;, or whatever bundle you created. If you do not plan on putting this piece of work out to tender, you can also click &lsquo;Confirmed? Yes&rsquo; in the table header. Click &lsquo;Save&rsquo;. If there&rsquo;s no price, click on Add Price and fill in the fields that come up with the relevant details, using whichever currency is relevant. Click &lsquo;save&rsquo; to finish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can edit your price later by returning to this page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s see how this price is looking. Navigate back to the book&rsquo;s Work P&amp;L and click on Origination (or whatever the cost group parent of your bundle is called). We can now see that our cost is recorded on the title&rsquo;s P&amp;L.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>To add production costs to automatically generated components.</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>The lines that automatically appear on the &lsquo;Work P&amp;L&rsquo; production costs section are mainly production and editorial origination. You can leave them blank if you want, but to add costs to these lines:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click &lsquo;Detail&rsquo; against the first line on the &lsquo;Work P&amp;L&rsquo; Title costs list. Enter your cost for the bundle name given, and a currency. You can also add a quantity, if you want, although it&rsquo;s not necessary as the quantity comes from the print order itself, not the printer estimate. Click &lsquo;save&rsquo;. Continue through all the components in turn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On hitting &lsquo;save&rsquo;, you&rsquo;ll see your aggregated costs appear in the &lsquo;Title costs&rsquo; part of the report. If the number you see in the Work P&amp;L page is not the total of the numbers you see on the Detail dialogue box, make sure you don&rsquo;t have two supplier estimates confirmed for a single production component. Look on Production runs > [name of production run] > Costs estimates to check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To edit production costs, click on local Title menu > [name of the production run] > Costs estimates and click on the cost amount to edit the costs. If there is no cost yet entered, click on Add a cost. You do not have to click a &lsquo;save&rsquo; button on this page.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>To add production component specs from scratch</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ll need to record the specs for the printing you&rsquo;re considering, such as its paper, its binding, its cover and so on. The team responsible for your print production costs should complete this section.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To add print component information:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the title&rsquo;s edit page, expand the &lsquo;Production&rsquo; menu option. Click on the print&rsquo;s link and then Specs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ll see links for all the possible production components: Covers, Papers, Bindings, Extra Parts, Embellishments, Finishes, and Origination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s add the cover information first. Click on &lsquo;Add cover&rsquo;. The first field is the bundle that this component will belong to. Unless you want to add a new bundle just for covers, select &lsquo;Main estimate&rsquo; from the dropdown list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be sure to tick the boxes at the top of the form which indicate the products that this cover is for. Click &lsquo;save&rsquo;. Repeat for any other components that you&rsquo;d like to spec out.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h5>To add editorial costs and components</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>It is good practice to use finance cost codes to track your spend in particular categories. You might refer to cost codes, finance codes, WIP codes or some other classification scheme. Bibliocloud calls them &lsquo;Finance Codes&rsquo; and you edit them in Settings. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Key points about adding an editorial cost:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You first describe the area of spend indicated by the cost code. (You allocate the actual amount of the spend separately.) You can gather a number of cost quotes for the work. Because of this, even if you don&rsquo;t want to consider more than one quote, you must click &lsquo;Accepted&rsquo; on the quote you want to go with, in order for it to appear on the book&rsquo;s P&amp;L. You can bundle costs any way you like: you can have one cost for typesetting, proofreading and line editing, or you break that cost down into separate costs. Let&rsquo;s add an editorial cost to a title, using an existing finance code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, go to your title&rsquo;s edit page. A good place to start is the Work P&amp;L page for the work in question: on the local Title menu, go to Workflow > Acquisition > Work P&amp;L. If your settings do not auto-populate finance codes, there won&rsquo;t be any sub-headings in the Title Costs section. If, however, your finance codes are set to auto-populate each time you create a new production (which is Biblicloud&rsquo;s default position), they&rsquo;ll have the cost-groups of your finance codes present in the Title Costs section but with no actual costs attached.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you now add a production run, you can easily add costs to each finance code. Click on the &lsquo;Add production run&rsquo; button, if it&rsquo;s there. (If it&rsquo;s not, there&rsquo;s already a production run for this title and you don&rsquo;t need to add one.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can now click on &lsquo;Detail&rsquo; against any of the cost groups, to add costs in easily. A nice thing about this approach is that you can have any sort of unit that you want. It makes sense for typesetting to be measured in units of a &lsquo;day&rsquo;. Another cost, such as picture research, might be better measured in numbers of pictures researched. If you need 20 pictures, you might put 20 as the quantity and GBP25 as the unit price, if it costs GBP25 per picture researched.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That all works well for cost groups and finance codes which are set up automatically on title creation and production run creation. If you want to add in cost groups, finance codes and costs manually, or in addition to the automatically generated ones, here&rsquo;s how you do it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>To add production quantities</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Click on &lsquo;Quantities &amp; deliveries&rsquo; on the local Title menu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find the column marked &lsquo;Print qty&rsquo;. Enter the quantity in the field provided. You do not have to save on this page. </p>\r\n\r\n<h5>To amend shipping data.</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a link called &lsquo;Shipments&rsquo; on each &lsquo;Production&rsquo; run which you can find on the local Title menu. You&rsquo;ll see it at Production > Production Runs > [find your production run] > Shipments. Click on the link, and you go to the shipment report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You only need to fill in this report if you manage your own shipping in-house &ndash; that is to say, if you buy space on container ships to move your stock from printer to warehouse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;Shipping&rsquo; is an aspect of a &lsquo;Delivery&rsquo;. Deliveries &ndash; when a printer sends their stock from the printing factory to your distributor, wholesalers or customers &ndash; is a production &lsquo;component&rsquo; and you can cost it like any other print component. Go to Quantities &amp; deliveries on a &lsquo;Production&rsquo; page to provide delivery information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &lsquo;Shipping&rsquo; report details one or more &lsquo;Shipments&rsquo;, which is a boat that&rsquo;s leaving dock from somewhere far away, on which you have space booked to transport your freshly-printed stock. The shipment report is constructed from a number of bits of data: they are the carton weight, the number of cartons and the cost per kilo for the &lsquo;shipment&rsquo; you&rsquo;re arranging. The &lsquo;Shipment&rsquo; report requires a &lsquo;Delivery&rsquo; record to be created, so that the system knows how much of the total print quantity is being sent on which shipments and at which rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are four steps to follow to add shipping rates to a production run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1) Set up Shipping Rates</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can store information about a shipping company&rsquo;s costs. This is known as a &lsquo;Shipping rate&rsquo; in Bibliocloud. You create a new &lsquo;Shipping rate&rsquo; record by going to Settings > ...for production > Shipping rates > Add new. Fill in the fields and click &lsquo;save&rsquo;. For example, if you know your shipping rates are USD0.55 per kilo for Hong Kong to US and USD0.47 per kilo for Hong Kong to UK, you would:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Create one shipping rate: go to Settings > ...for production > Shipping rates > Add new Select USD from the first dropdown field, marked Currency Type 0.55 in &lsquo;cost per kilo&rsquo; Select a valid date range e.g. from today&rsquo;s date to a year from now. Select US as the destination &lsquo;Ship to country&rsquo; Select the correct shipping company e.g. APOL(HK) You would then create a second Shipping rate with the destination country being UK and the cost per kilo being 0.47. Hit Save to save each record.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2) Set up Shipments</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve entered your shipping rates, you can create a new &lsquo;Shipment&rsquo; record, which will use one of those rates. Go to Settings > ...for production > Shipments > Add new. You can select the &lsquo;Shipping rate&rsquo; you&rsquo;ve just created &ndash; it&rsquo;ll be in the &lsquo;Shipping rate&rsquo; drop down list. If you know that you have a boat leaving HK in January, you would:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Create one shipment: go toSettings > ...for production > Shipments > Add new Select USD for the currency Select the date that the boat will leave: say, January 15th Select the date that the boat is expected to arrive: say, February 15th Select your US Shipping Rate that you&rsquo;ve just created Select the relevant shipping company 3) Enter how many units you&rsquo;re going to produce</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you haven&rsquo;t yet entered quantity information for the production run, do so now by navigating to the production record and to &lsquo;Quantity&rsquo; on the local Title menu. Add in the correct production quantity in the Print quantity column.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4) Set up deliveries</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the same page (Production > Production runs > [your run] > Quantity &amp; deliveries), next to the relevant edition in the Line level detail sales forecasts and orders table, click on &lsquo;Add delivery&rsquo;. This will set up a delivery for the quantity forecast. Once it&rsquo;s created, you&rsquo;ll be able to add the shipment itself to the delivery. Still in the Quantities page, click on the delivery you&rsquo;ve just added (it&rsquo;s at the foot of the page) . Add the shipment reference from the drop down list labelled Shipment, at the bottom of the form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4) View the Shipment report for your production run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now the basics are set up, you can see the shipment report. Click on Production > [name of the production run] > Quantities &amp; deliveries > Shipping tab. You&rsquo;ll be taken to the &lsquo;Shipment report&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5) Confirm the shipping costs</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are happy with the numbers, click the button marked &lsquo;Confirm shipment cost as x&rsquo; at the bottom of the table. That will make the total shipment costs number appear on the forecast P&amp;L.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Troubleshooting:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you haven&rsquo;t entered the carton quantity, weight per carton and cartons per pallet for the print, you won&rsquo;t be able to see the shipping report. These fields are at the top of the Quantities and deliveries > Shipping tab page. If you don&rsquo;t see any detail on the shipping report, you might not have linked the shipment with your delivery. Go to Quantities &amp; deliveries, click on the delivery and make sure the field marked &lsquo;Shipment&rsquo; is filled in. If there&rsquo;s nothing to select, follow points 1) and 2) of this &lsquo;How To&rsquo; to add a shipping rate and a shipment.\r\n\r\n<h5>To generate a PDF</h5>\r\n<p>On the local Title menu, click on Data management > Exports > P&amp;L (PDF). Your file will download.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>To record an actual supplier invoice</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a two or three-stage process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best way is to firstly reserve some spend from the budget, secondly create the Purchase Order and thirdly, pay the Purchase Order off. This means you have an audit trail all the way from first signing off the budget to receiving money in from the supplier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A less robust way is to miss out the spend reservation step, and jump straight to creating the Purchase Order, then pay the Purchase Order off. Doing it this way means you can still match supplier invoices with purchase orders, but it&rsquo;s more difficult to reconcile it to the original budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if you&rsquo;re not going to send the Purchase Order to the supplier, or even if the order&rsquo;s already been sent and you just want to add a supplier invoice to Bibliocloud, you need to create the Purchase Order in Bibliocloud so the system knows what the supplier invoice is for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll look at the most robust way first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Either: Reserve some spend and create a Purchase Order On your Work P&amp;L, in the Costs section, click on Detail next to the cost category you want. So if the invoice is for Colour Repro, click on Detail under its forecast in the Forecasts column.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the screen that appears, click on Reserve money on the relevant line. If you can&rsquo;t click on it, it&rsquo;s because you haven&rsquo;t yet confirmed the contribution. To to that, click &lsquo;Confirm contribution as [GBPx]&rsquo; on the Work P&amp;L page. This freezes your forecast as a budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A notice pops up to ask if you want to reserve some money. Click Reserve some funds now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click Reserve new spend amount and enter the amount of the invoice in &lsquo;Money Amount&rsquo;. Optionally, add some info into the other fields, if you like. Click Reserve some funds now and you&rsquo;re taken back to the spend reservation form. You&rsquo;ll see that you&rsquo;ve reserved some of the budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now we&rsquo;re going to create a Purchase Order from your reserved spend record. Tick the checkbox on the left hand side of the Spend Reservation note and click on &lsquo;Create purchase order from selected items&rsquo;. The page refreshes and you&rsquo;ll have a link to the new PO, highlighted in red. Click on the link under &lsquo;Purchase orders for lines on this spend reservation:&rsquo; to see it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or: create a Purchase Order without reserving any spend From your P&amp;L, in the Costs area, click on Detail next to the cost category you want. So if the invoice is for Colour Repro, click on Detail under its forecast in the Forecasts column. Click on Add unauthorised PO. It is unauthorised because you&rsquo;re not creating a spend reservation first. Select the organisation you&rsquo;re placing the order with. Adding a sales channel is necessary &ndash; if there isn&rsquo;t a suitable one here already, add one in Settings > ...for sales > Sales Channels > Add new. Hit Save and then on the page which appears, click on Add a line item. Enter your details and click Save.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless of which approach you used above, the final step is the same: we pay the Purchase Order off from our supplier invoice that we&rsquo;ve received.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pay the Purchase Order off. We can match a Supplier Invoice to a Purchase Order in a number of ways:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the Purchase order. Click the red outlined button on the right hand side of the Purchase Order labelled Record a supplier invoice for this PO. Select the correct print component in the last field at the bottom of the page if it&rsquo;s not already selected. Check the details are OK and click Save. From the production area. On the local title menu, click on Production > the name of the print run > Purchase Order and Invoice. In the Purchase Order section, click on the red button marked Record a Supplier invoice for this PO. Select the correct print component in the last field at the bottom of the page if it&rsquo;s not already selected, then save the page to confirm the amount is correct. It&rsquo;ll now appear in the right place on the P&amp;L. From the P&amp;L. In the Costs area, click on Detail next to the cost category you want. Click on &lsquo;See all POs&rsquo;. Find the section headed Purchase Orders: you can click Record a supplier invoice for this PO next to the purchase order. Select the correct print component in the last field at the bottom of the page if it&rsquo;s not already selected. Check the details are OK and click Save. </p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rights costs</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The rights cost is the percentage of rights revenue that goes to the author. Normally, it&rsquo;s the percentage you enter when you&rsquo;re adding the type of right to the contract. If the rights revenue estimate has been entered without saying which type of right it is for, the system will assume that the author gets 80% of the revenue (80% being a sort of industry standard, according to the Society of Authors). If you click on Agreements > Contract > Edit > Rights you can correct this.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Other reports available about acquisition</h4>\r\n\r\n<h5>Work P&L (detailed)</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>This page is the same as the Work P&amp;L, except that the costs detail at the finance code level is not tucked away in pop-up boxes with a cost group summary, but is printed on the page. This makes for a much busier page, but is useful if you want to see the finance code detail at a glance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both the Work P&amp;L and the Work P&amp;L (detail) are printed on the PDF which you can download from Data management > Exports > P&amp;L (PDF).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a Product P&amp;L page, created entirely by Bibliocloud: you don&rsquo;t need to input any more data to see it. It takes the simple information that you entered for the sales forecasts, and attempts to construct a detailed view of the data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To construct this detailed view, Bibliocloud uses the Sales Profiles and Returns Profiles that you selected for the sales forecasts. It also uses a number of the default settings that you add to the channel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To add a new channel, go to Main menu > Settings > ...for sales > Channels > Add new. Type the name of the channel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to get channels right from the start, if you intend to use Bibliocloud to run your royalties. Bibliocloud can calculate royalties at channel level (amongst other things), but only if you import your sales tagged up with the channel that they belong to. This means if you create a channel called &lsquo;US Sales&rsquo;, you need to be sure that you want to report royalties for &lsquo;US sales&rsquo;, and that you will be able to import sales from &lsquo;US sales&rsquo;. If you actually want to be able to calculate royalties at a lower level, for instance &lsquo;US Concessions&rsquo;, &lsquo;US Trade Shows&rsquo;, &lsquo;US Author Gratis&rsquo;, then firstly create those channels, but also make sure you&rsquo;ll be able to import sales tagged up accordingly in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bibliocloud takes the default royalty rate from the sales channel, but you can override this or the royalty basis at the product level. On the Product P&amp;L report, find the channel you want to override the royalty rate on. Click Override in the header area. Enter the revised royalty percentage in the box and click &lsquo;save&rsquo;. Your new rate will be used just for this product and this channel&rsquo;s P&amp;L detail report. The default royalty rate on the channel will not be overridden. The new royalty amount will appear on both the P&amp;L detail and the Work P&amp;L report.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To override the basis: On the Product P&amp;L report, find the channel you want to override the royalty basis on. Click &lsquo;Override&rsquo; in the header area. Select your desired royalty basis and click &lsquo;save&rsquo;. The default royalty basis on the channel will not be overridden. The new royalty basis will be used for the calculation on both the Product P&amp;L and the Work P&amp;L report. To revert to the channel default, click [remove &amp; use channel default].</p>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can download this report by clicking the &lsquo;Download PDF&rsquo; button. Its data is also included in the full P&amp;L pack which you can download from the local Title menu: Data management > Exports > P&amp;L (PDF).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report has one section per product / channel. So if you have more than one product, there will be more than one section to the report. And if you have forecasts for more than one channel, there will be a separate part of the report for each channel, within each product. If you would rather see the report at a channel-only level, rather than seeing it split out by product, look at the 'Forecast by channel' page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* * *</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The remaining menu options to do with acquisitions are tucked away under &lsquo;More&rsquo;, since they are less frequently visited and not mandatory at all. However some of these options throw an interesting alternative light on the same data, so they&rsquo;re worth looking through.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>More: Confirmed orders</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s possible that you will have received actual customer orders before you sign the title off, and so rather than entering them as a sales forecast it makes more sense to enter these as an actual order. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Confirmed revenue is revenue that is definitely going to be received, at forecasting stage, such as sales orders agreed as ex-works sales, Kickstarter funds or grants. To add confirmed revenue, on the Work P&amp;L report, you can click on the blue plus circle next to &lsquo;Revenue / Confirmed gross revenue&rsquo;. Complete the form that pops up and click &lsquo;save&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the order page that appears, click &lsquo;Add line item&rsquo;. Complete the form that pops up. Click &lsquo;save&rsquo;. If you want the amount to appear on the P&amp;L you must set the status from Draft to Approved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can add as many sales orders as you like, by clicking again on the &lsquo;Add sales order&rsquo; button on the books page. You can edit an existing sales order by clicking on its edit icon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notes:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;Contact&rsquo; is the person or company who is going to receive the order. If there are no contacts on the drop down list, or if you want to create a new one, add one via Main menu > Publishing > Address book > Add new. If you want this sales order to appear on the Work P&amp;L, select &lsquo;Approved&rsquo; from the &lsquo;Status&rsquo; dropdown list. If it&rsquo;s not confirmed but you still want the value to appear on the &lsquo;Work P&amp;L&rsquo;, enter the forecast sale as a &lsquo;Sales estimate&rsquo;. If there are no currencies on the drop down list, or if you want to create a new one, go to Main menu > Settings > ...for finance > Currencies > Add new. If there are no channels and masterchannels on the drop down lists, or if you want to create new ones, go to Main menu > Settings > ...for sales > Channels > Add new, and complete the fields. At channel level, you can record some default rates such as the average distribution rate, the sales rep rate, the average royalty rate and the default royalty basis. You might want to add these items now, as you&rsquo;ll be needing these to be completed to see your product and channel level P&amp;L forecasts. You must add each channel that you create to a masterchannel. For example, you might name a masterchannel &lsquo;All UK&rsquo;, and have it contain &lsquo;UK Home&rsquo;, &lsquo;UK Trade&rsquo;, &lsquo;UK Concessions&rsquo; and &lsquo;UK Gratis&rsquo;. This hierarchy matters because you&rsquo;ll pay different royalty rates for different channels, so you need to store your data accordingly. Once you&rsquo;ve added in your sales orders, return to the Work P&amp;L report by following the link on the menu. Your confirmed sales orders appear at the top as a summary. On the Product P&amp;L, you can view and amend any information such as the royalty basis, the royalty rates, the price and the channel-level default rates.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the local Title menu, click on Workflow > Acquisition > Confirmed orders. The orders that you enter will appear on the Confirmed orders page, and also in summary on the Work P&amp;L.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have entered a confirmed order, but not actually set its status to &lsquo;Approved&rsquo;, it won&rsquo;t appear on the P&amp;L. There will be a line on the Confirmed orders page which reads something like &lsquo;You do have draft orders for London Scene 9780954575922 (Trade paperback 14.99). Set them to &lsquo;Approved&rsquo; to see them here.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(It might seem odd that you have to &lsquo;approve&rsquo; a &lsquo;confirmed&rsquo; sales order. That&rsquo;s necessary, though, because you might need to enter a &lsquo;draft&rsquo; sales order when you think it&rsquo;s going to be placed by a customer, and then when they&rsquo;ve given it the go ahead, change its status to &lsquo;approved&rsquo;.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bibliocloud takes the default royalty rate from the sales channel, but you can override this at the product level. On the confirmed sales report, find the channel you want to override the royalty rate on. Click &lsquo;Override&rsquo; in the royalty rate column. Enter the revised royalty percentage in the box and click &lsquo;save&rsquo;. Your new rate will be used just for this product and this channel&rsquo;s P&amp;L detail report. The default royalty rate on the channel will not be overridden. The new royalty amount will appear on both the Product P&amp;L and the Work P&amp;L report.</p>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like sales forecasts, confirmed orders appear on the Work P&amp;L as well as the more detailed Confirmed orders page.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>MORE: Forecast by channel</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>On the local Title menu, click on Workflow > Acquisition > More > Forecast by channel. This is another report, produced by Bibliocloud with no input from you, which takes the same data from the Work P&amp;L and the Product P&amp;L and summarises it to the channel level. If you want to see these numbers at a more detailed level, look at Product P&amp;L.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>MORE: Author forecast</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>On the local Title menu, click on Workflow > Acquisition > More > Author forecast. The author forecast page is a useful tool to share with authors &ndash; in part, or in whole &ndash; before agreeing to publish their book. It provides an insight into what the author or agent should expect to receive over the initial five years of the title&rsquo;s publication. From your point of view, it gives you an indication of the royalty cost that you&rsquo;ll be liable for, based on the forecasts you&rsquo;ve entered.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>MORE: Spend reservations</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>On the local Title menu, click on Workflow > Acquisition > More > Spend reservations. If there are any spend reservations recorded, they&rsquo;ll be listed here. Click on one and you&rsquo;ll see its details. You&rsquo;ll see a reference number which you should quote on any manual or verbal purchase orders made. If you&rsquo;re on the phone to your typesetter, you can say &lsquo;use the reference &lsquo;1-1-260&rsquo; on your invoice and it&rsquo;ll help me put your invoice against the right budget, so we can authorise your payment quicker&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can click on the highlighted Purchase Order line to see associated purchase orders &ndash; and there&rsquo;s a button labelled &lsquo;Record a supplier invoice for this PO&rsquo; on that page so you can add in the invoice details when they come in.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>MORE: Waterfall chart</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>On the local Title menu, click on Workflow > Acquisition > More > Waterfall chart. If you have entered any forecast data, you&rsquo;ll see it now in pictorial form. The waterfall chart depicts the forecast flow of money in and out of the company for this title, with the x (horizontal) axis roughly reflecting time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the first cash outflows to happen with a title is the advance payment, and so the first column shows the advance payment. Next, there&rsquo;s the amount of money you&rsquo;re planning to spend on production. If you are paying for shipping, this will appear next. The grey &lsquo;subtotal&rsquo; column tots up your costs so far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &lsquo;Est sales&rsquo; (estimated sales) column is, hopefully, cheerfully towering above your costs incurred so far. You might even have some revenue recorded in the Confirmed sales column. But then we see more costs, such as distribution costs, sales commission, and royalties. You get another subtotal of postpublication costs, and then finally the contribution in the last column &ndash; otherwise known as your margin: the difference between your sales and your costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MORE: Analysis</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the local Title menu, click on Workflow > Acquisition > Analysis. This is another pictorial representation of the data you&rsquo;ve entered so far, with charts showing an overview, your forecast gross sales, your forecast returns value and quantity, your net sales and, most interestingly, their cumulative net sale value.</p>"], [59, "Agreements", "<h4>Permissions</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Bibliocloud allows you to manage both incoming and outgoing permission requests. You can look at them on the main menu, and also on the local title menu. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>An incoming permissions request contains information about who wants permission, for what, for how long. Enter that information in the form that appears. You can also create a purchase order to send to the requester once you&rsquo;ve saved the permission request&rsquo;s details. Fill in the section that appears marked &lsquo;Permission order basics&rsquo;, and the line level detail on the following page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An outgoing permissions request contains information about who we requested permission from, for what, for how long. Enter that information in the form that appears.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Rights</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>To add a rights deal: License the rights to a title from an author or agent, and store the terms of the agreement in the head contract. Before you can sell rights, you have to control them in the first place in your head contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sub-license the rights to another publisher, and store the terms of this agreement in a deal contract. Once you have the right to sell various sub licenses, you can create a &lsquo;deal&rsquo;. This is an agreement between you and another publisher, which entitles them to publish a product of your title in another form, language, territory or a mixture of these.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Co-editions</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>To add a co-edition deal: License the co-edition rights to a title from an author or agent, and store the terms of the agreement in the head contract. Before you can sell rights, you have to control them in the first place. In your head contract make sure that one of the rights you record is &lsquo;Co-edition&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Agree a co-edition deal with another publisher, and store the terms of this agreement in a deal contract. Once you have the right to sell various sub licenses, you can create a &lsquo;deal&rsquo;. This is an agreement between you and another publisher, which entitles them to publish a product of your title in another form, language, territory or a mixture of these.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time as negotiating your deal, you can capture information about the co-edition product itself, in a single form for convenience.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Contracts</h4>\r\n<p> Whether you choose to manage your author, agent and other contributor information through Bibliocloud or not, the contract records in Bibliocloud are an important part of your system. One contract record will exist for each title, even if it only contains a small amount of data, because Bibliocloud will create it in the background when you set up a new title.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You don&rsquo;t need to create contracts &ndash; a blank contract is created automatically when you create a title. A contract is live when it&rsquo;s got a signed date, and a live contract is locked for editing. You save time and ensure consistency by using templates to lay out the majority of a contract&rsquo;s text. You specify advances, rights, royalty rules and more in the contract, and these data control functionality in other parts of Bibliocloud. All of the information that forms part of a deal with an author, agent or other third party is stored in Bibliocloud in a structured fashion, and embedded into the PDF of the contract. This way you can be sure that whatever you contractually agree is reflected in real life and in the rest of Bibliocloud:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Royalties get paid at the same rates as in the contract. </li>\r\n<li>Key dates get adhered to </li>\r\n<li>Advances get paid on time </li>\r\n<li>Territories get respected </li>\r\n<li>You can only sell the rights you&rsquo;ve licensed in the head contract.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n <p>So to get the best out of Bibliocloud, sooner or later you&rsquo;ll be dealing with contractual data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click on Search on the Main menu > Publishing > Agreements > Contract, and use the search tools to find a contract. Click on one of the contract names and you&rsquo;ll go to the contract. You&rsquo;ll notice that it&rsquo;s part of its title&rsquo;s page: you could also have got here by navigating to the product or title and clicking on Agreements on the local title menu.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can click on Preview to preview the contract as it will appear when it&rsquo;s printed out as a PDF, or you can click on Edit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A contract is live when it&rsquo;s got a signed date &ndash; you&rsquo;ll find this field under &lsquo;Contract details > Agreement&rsquo;. Once it&rsquo;s live, the only field you can amend is the signed date itself (if you actually do need to make a change. This activity is logged).</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Agreement</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>The first tab contains the basics of the agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other fields on this page concern dates and author benefits. Fill them in as you see fit. Much of the data will appear in the schedules of the printed out contract &ndash; click on Preview to see how you&rsquo;re doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Rates</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>This page is where you can add royalty specifiers to create as complex a set of royalty rates as you want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A royalty specifier is a set of specifications for a royalty calculation. It states a base royalty rate, and the ways in which it can change based on particular conditions. It is sufficiently detailed to be used as the basis for the royalty calculation, and sufficiently well structured to be embedded in a contract document.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can enter the method of royalty calculation, and the rates you want to pay, for each sales channel. You&rsquo;ll see a visual hierarchy, with the contract at the top, then the work, then one or more books, and the channels contracted. You&rsquo;ll want to add a royalty specifier for every product on the contract &ndash; at either the product or the sales channel level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read how to add a royalty specifier to a product in section 10.5.5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ll next want to add a new masterchannel for every type of sale you want to pay royalties against. Click on the link &lsquo;Add new Masterchannel&rsquo; on a product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the page you are sent to, you can select a masterchannel from the drop down list. If there are none there, or if you want to add a new one, click on the &lsquo;edit masterchannels&rsquo; link. Click &lsquo;save&rsquo; and you&rsquo;ll be taken back to the &lsquo;Royalty&rsquo; section of the contract page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ve already set a base specifier at the book level. Now, you can override it at the masterchannel level, if you want, or leave it as it is.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bs-callout bs-callout-info\"><h4>Specify royalties</h4>\r\n<p>Click on the &lsquo;No royalty specifier&rsquo; link for the masterchannel. Fill in the fields as required:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Base Royalty Rate:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you enter a percentage here, and leave all the following fields blank, this will be the royalty rate for all sales. You can make adjustments to this basic rate by adding in quantity escalators, date escalators and price amendments. For this and the other fields, enter the rate as a number, without the % sign. If you want the rate to be 15%, enter 15.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Guaranteed minimum royalty rate:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you enter a minimum percentage rate here, this will override any other settings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maximum possible royalty rate:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to ensure you don&rsquo;t pay royalties over a certain rate, set a ceiling for the royalty rate here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Quantity Basis:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can set up the system to calculate royalties on a quantity escalator. This means that you can pay one rate on the first, say, 1000 units, and another rate on subsequent sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&raquo; Select &lsquo;Escalator (Add)&rsquo; so that you can later provide the percentage point rise for each quantity range you want to pay royalties on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Date Basis:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two &lsquo;Escalator&rsquo; options allow you to have royalties calculated at different rates based on the date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&raquo; Select &lsquo;Escalator (Add)&rsquo; so that you can later provide the percentage point rise, for each date range you want to pay royalties on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&raquo; Select &lsquo;Escalator (Multiply)&rsquo; so that you can later provide a percentage by which the royalty rate should be multiplied, for each date range you want to pay royalties in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Price Basis:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&raquo; Select &lsquo;List&rsquo; to have royalties calculated as a percentage of the price on the back of the book. You don&rsquo;t need to enter any additional information after this: the system will calculate royalties based on the list price.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&raquo; Select &lsquo;Discount&rsquo; to have royalties calculated on the sales value you receive from customers, after their discounts have been taken off (often known as &lsquo;net receipts&rsquo;). You don&rsquo;t need to enter any additional information after this: the system will calculate royalties based on net receipts. The two &lsquo;Escalator&rsquo; options allow you to have royalties calculated at different rates based on the discount you sell at.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&raquo; Select &lsquo;Escalator (Add)&rsquo; so that you can later provide the percentage point rise, for each discount level you want to pay royalties on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&raquo; Select &lsquo;Escalator (Multiply)&rsquo; so that you can later provide a percentage by which the royalty rate should be multiplied, for each discount level you want to pay royalties on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&raquo; Select &lsquo;Inherit&rsquo; to use the settings from the next level up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve made the changes on this page, refresh the page to bring up a set of fields into which you can add the actual rates. Add as many as you require.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Where they are</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Royalty specifiers are viewed and modified as part of a contract &ndash; in fact the same data that you specify as part of a contract is used to calculate the royalties themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>What they apply to</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>An individual specifier is associated either with:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All sales of a product. All sales of a product in a particular sales master channel. All sales of a product in a particular sales channel. If no royalty specifier is present for a sales channel then the specifier for the parent master channel is considered. If there is no specifier present for a master channel then the specifier for the product is considered. It is also possible for a specifier to inherit particular attributes from a parent, so we can modify the royalties for a particular channel in respect of, say, the base rate, while also using the same date escalator steps as defined for the product. Elements of a specifier</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Royalty specifiers have the following elements:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A base rate percentage</li> \r\n<li>A guaranteed lower limit \r\n<li>An upper limit \r\n<li>A price specifier \r\n<li>A data specifier \r\n<li>A quantity specifier </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>Base Rate Percentage </h5>\r\n<p>The base rate is the unmodified rate at which royalties will be paid.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>SALES RIGHTS</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>These are the sales rights that you have for your products. There are different types of right, and for each one you can specify the territories to which it applies. Although you can define sales rights in terms of the territories that you can sell products in, it is best practice to also define territories in which you cannot sell the product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>National coverage checker</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This list of countries helps you to check that you have supplied exactly one sales right type for every country. A lack of any sales right for a country will display a warning background colour, and specifying multiple sales rights will display a danger background colour. Failing to specify rights for a country can often best be resolved by using the &ldquo;Regions included&rdquo; code &ldquo;ROW: Rest of world&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Countries by special territory</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This list of special territories and countries helps you to check that in complex sales right specifications you have consistent sales right types within territories, if that is your aim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LICENSED RIGHTS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The licensed rights tab contains details of all the rights that you&rsquo;re licensing in this agreement. It also contains the percentage of revenue that the signatory will receive if you sub license any of these rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to sub license any rights, this part of the contract has to be filled in. Bibliocloud won&rsquo;t let you sell French rights if you haven&rsquo;t licensed them in this head agreement in the first place.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>ADVANCES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s best to store data in Bibliocloud so that it reflects reality as closely as possible. So, if you&rsquo;re going to pay an advance in three instalments (on signature, on delivery and on publication, for example), enter three separate Advance records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, if you&rsquo;re going to pay GBP10000 in total, with GBP3000 on signature, GBP3000 on delivery and GBP4000 on publication, then you should add three advance records, for each of those values, with the correct trigger recorded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once an advance has a paid date, Bibliocloud will create a payment record behind the scenes: you&rsquo;ll be able to access it in the &lsquo;Payments&rsquo; information block. If the advance hasn&rsquo;t been paid, make sure you don&rsquo;t enter a date in the &lsquo;Paid date&rsquo; field, otherwise the system won&rsquo;t prompt you to pay the advance when it&rsquo;s due.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAYMENTS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Record here money that you pay out to signatories. It would be disastrous to fail to record money you&rsquo;ve paid out, because the system will expect you to pay it at the next royalty period &ndash; and you don&rsquo;t want to pay money out twice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DELIVERY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If there are complex delivery terms, such as 30 illustrations by June 20th and the rest by Christmas, you can articulate them here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RESERVES</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An important area to note which provides for money to be withheld by the publisher against the risk of future returns from customers.</p>\r\n<div class=\"bs-callout bs-callout-info\"><h4>Reserves against returns</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Avoid returned sales royalty shocks! The reserve against returns is a proportion of sales that are held back from the royalty payment process against the contingency of a significant number of returns of unsold stock from retailers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are currently two ways in which the reserve can be defined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a default rate against a sales channels As an agreed rate against a sales channel for a particular contract. In both cases the rate can be varied by the statement number, so that the reserve for the first statement might be 24%, for the second 20%, for the third 5%, and for the fourth and subsequent statements 0%.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Setting default reserve rates for a sales channel</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Select the Settings > for sales > Channels. The channel list will be presented. Select the channel for which you wish to set a return against reserve rate, and the Edit Channel page will open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the &lsquo;Default reserve against return rates&rsquo; section, click on the &lsquo;Add reserve rate&rsquo; link, and two text entry boxes appear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bibliocloud allows different rates to be set from specified statement numbers onwards. To set a single rate for all statements for this channel, add a &lsquo;1&rsquo; to the first box and the required rate to the second.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To specify further rates, click on the &lsquo;Add reserve rates&rsquo; link and repeat the entry of required values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can see the specification of descending return against reserve rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CHANNEL DEFAULT RESERVE AGAINST RETURN RATES DEMO</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this example, the reserve against return rates for contract statements will be as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Statement Number Return Against Reserve Rate 1 25% 2 20% 3 10% 4 0% 5 and subsequent 0% Press save, and either return to the channel list, or press the navigation arrows to move to a different channel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This pattern of reducing the reserve rate serves to release previously reserved royalty amounts as the contract progresses. If a total amount of GBP500 were reserved on statement 1, GBP100 of this amount would then be released on statement 2 in addition to newly earned royalties.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h5>Payees</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>The contributors to a work might not be the same as the signatory to the contract, so you can enter contributors to the contract here.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>FILES</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>You can upload signed scanned copies of current and past contracts here, as well as addendums and other attachments not provided for in Bibliocloud e.g. series heads of agreement, or option documentation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>CONTRACT TEXT</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Whilst royalties and other data are an important part of a contract, there is the small matter of the bulk of the words that go to make up this legal document. You can define a contract template which contains your legal text clauses, and also embed key data into the text such as the author name, the word count and so on. It&rsquo;s the same sort of functionality that you&rsquo;d see in a mail merge in word processing software.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Contract templates</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>A contract template is a reusable collection of legal clauses that can be used to quickly create contracts, and encourage as much consistency as possible between your contracts whilst allowing for maximum negotiation flexibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HOW TO CREATE A CONTRACT TEMPLATE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First of all, you should put together the chunks of text that will form the contract template. These might be the individual contract clauses, or they might be larger bundles of text. For instance, your boilerplate contract might have prelims, then the main body of the text, then it would contain a few schedules and appendices. You might choose to put all of these into one big text chunk, or split out the sections so you can reuse them in more than one contract template.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start by creating a boilerplate contract with a main body and an appendix of territorial rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Go to Settings > ...for legal > Contract templates > Add new. Type in a contract template name and click &lsquo;save&rsquo;. Click on &lsquo;Add new clause&rsquo; and paste the body of your contract into the text area. You can put as much or as little as you want into the field: either one clause, or the whole contract, or a sub-section. Provide a descriptive name so you can search by it later: for instance, &lsquo;Main boilerplate body&rsquo;. Click &lsquo;save&rsquo; and you&rsquo;ll be taken to a further editing page. On both pages, you can add some tags to your text. These tags embed the relevant data into your contract. So, for instance, if you edit your text to something like this:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Work entitled <work_title> shall be of <page_count> pages and <word_count> words and shall be delivered to the Publisher by <delivery_date>. It will appear in the contract PDF as something like this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Work entitled 1000 Dreams shall be of 280 pages and 65,000 words and shall be delivered to the Publisher by 01 June 2014. Add another clause by clicking on Add new clause and pasting in, for instance, the list of territories that your contract will cover. Give it a meaningful title e.g. &lsquo;List of main territories&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the contract template page, tick the clauses you&rsquo;ve created and click on &lsquo;save&rsquo;. The text will appear on the right. Drag your clauses into the correct order by clicking, holding and dragging the icon. You don&rsquo;t need to hit &lsquo;save&rsquo; to save the order - it&rsquo;s done automatically. Click on the text to edit it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your template is now ready to attach to a contract, so let&rsquo;s go to the Contracts area and do that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HOW TO ADD A CONTRACT TEMPLATE TO A CONTRACT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Go to the title edit page of the title that you want to add the template to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s a field half way down the first box called &lsquo;Template name&rsquo;. Click on it and you&rsquo;ll see your recently-created template. Select it and click &lsquo;save&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can also apply a contract template to a rights deal. The &lsquo;Contract template&rsquo; field is in the &lsquo;Deal&rsquo; section of a rights deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once a contract template has been used on a contract, it can&rsquo;t be amended. This is to avoid the obviously undesirable situation of the text of a contract being changed once the contract is agreed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HOW TO AMEND A CONTRACT TEMPLATE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to amend a contract template that is already in use on a signed contract, the best thing to do is duplicate it and make your amendments on the new template. There&rsquo;s no limit on how many templates you store in Bibliocloud. To duplicate a contract, click on Main menu > Settings > ...for Legal > Contract templates > Search. Click on &lsquo;dupe&rsquo; on the listing page. Your contract template is duplicated, ready for editing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HOW TO ADD AN ERRATURM TO A CONTRACT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have signed a contract, you don&rsquo;t want to edit it, because the recipient won&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s changed. Bibliocloud won&rsquo;t let you amend a signed contract. You can, however, add an erratum. We add errata to the contract template, since all contracts that use it will be affected. Go to the contract template in question and click on Add erratum. Add the detail in. The new erratum clause will appear at the bottom of the contract template and also on each contracts&rsquo; edit and preview page. Bibliocloud won&rsquo;t prompt you to send it to the author &ndash; that&rsquo;s an exercise left to the reader.</p>\r\n<h5>RIGHTS</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>RIGHTS DEALS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This section stores the rights deals you make with third party publishers and licensors. You can also access rights deals from the local title menu for the relevant title. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve licensed rights, you can sublicense them: make sure you&rsquo;ve set up your head contract first, and record the rights that you&rsquo;ve licensed. This &lsquo;how to&rsquo; covers rights without a co-edition. If you want to set up a co-edition deal, read section 10.6.3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Navigate to the title that you want to sublicense rights of. Click on Agreements > Rights deal > Add new deal and add the language, if it&rsquo;s a translation deal. If the language will not change on this deal, select your home language e.g. English. Click on &lsquo;Save&rsquo;. You&rsquo;ll be taken to the edit page of the rights deal you&rsquo;ve just created. It&rsquo;s mostly empty at this stage, so now you can record whatever information you know about the deal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DEAL STAGE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can store whether a deal is just an expression of interest, or signed and sealed. We will select &lsquo;Interest&rsquo; for the time being.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>LICENSOR</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The licensor is the company who you&rsquo;re licensing the sub-rights to. The drop down list contains all the contacts which are Companies in the Address Book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AGENCY</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can add in an agency contact if you like.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PUBLISHER</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes, you license subrights to an agency, who then in turn license the publishing rights on to a publisher. If the licensor and the publisher are different, you can store the publisher here. The drop down list contains all the contacts which are Companies in the Address Book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>CONTACT</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The contact is your named person with whom you&rsquo;re dealing. The drop down list contains all contacts which are &lsquo;People&rsquo; in the Address Book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RIGHTS TYPE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can only sell rights that you&rsquo;ve licensed. In this image, there are no licensed rights, so the drop down is empty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To add options to that list, go to the head contract (Agreements > Contract > Edit). Complete the relevant fields in the Rights section. Return to this page and you&rsquo;ll see the drop down list filled in. Using your browser&rsquo;s back button is the most straightforward way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FORMAT</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Select whether the license is for a mono or an illustrated book, if it&rsquo;s relevant and you want to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TEMPLATE NAME</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Select the correct template from the drop down list. This will provide the words that go to make up the PDF contract. Fill in the remaining fields as you see fit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ADVANCE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a rights deal, an advance is paid to you by the publisher that you&rsquo;ve licensed the rights to. You need to store that information so that you can ensure you get your advance paid on time and to the correct value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Select the currency from the drop down list. If the currency you need doesn&rsquo;t appear, follow the instructions here to add a new one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enter the value in the currency that is detailed in the contract. Ensure you enter it without including any tax.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The system will calculate the advance value in your base currency if you leave &lsquo;Advance value in GBP&rsquo; blank. To override this number, which is based on your stated currency conversion rate, you can type the correct value in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Date agreed is the date you agreed the advance with the publisher. This is useful so that your colleagues can see your negotiation in progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you enter a paid date for the &lsquo;Advance&rsquo;, Bibliocloud will create a receipt record &ndash; the money paid by the other publisher to you &ndash; in the background.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You are also able to store tax rate and value, if they apply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>RECEIPTS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve saved your advance record, if you&rsquo;ve included a paid date, go to the &lsquo;Receipts&rsquo; tab. You&rsquo;ll see that Bibliocloud has created a receipt record. Amend it, if you like, to include more information, such as the method of payment by the third party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PAYMENTS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you add a date in &lsquo;Payment made to contributor&rsquo; in the &lsquo;Receipt&rsquo; record, the system will create a &lsquo;Payment&rsquo; record in the background based on the author cut you recorded earlier. Go to &lsquo;Payments&rsquo;, the next tab down on the left hand navigation menu, to see the payment record.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>RIGHTS GUIDE</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>This page allows you to configure which titles are to be included and excluded from the rights guide, and to preview its contents. Click Download > Export Rights guide on this page to download a PDF rights guide. It&rsquo;s a big file so this runs in the background. Keep an eye on the bell icon, top right, which will go green when the report is finished and ready to download.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>PERMISSIONS</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>This area lists all incoming and outgoing permissions. There is also a useful Requests Processor, if you have any requests to be processed. You can drag and drop the permissions requests between headings to update their status from &lsquo;Enquiry&rsquo; to &lsquo;Agreed&rsquo;, &lsquo;On hold&rsquo; or &lsquo;Expired&rsquo;.

The List Overview shows you all the products published in the next 12 months from today’s date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As well as the Advanced search feature, there is a search bar that appears at the top of every single page in Bibliocloud, with a magnifying glass icon. You can enter an ISBN13 or a title in here, and Bibliocloud will give you a list of products that contains one of those terms. Here are some more of the features on this page:</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Group by</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>A nice feature if you want to have sub-headings in your listing. You can group by imprint, pub month, edition, contributor, subject or owner. If you choose to save your search, these groupings will be saved, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Batch actions</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>You can run various batch actions using the drop down menu so marked. First, refine your search results, and then further refine your selection by checking the boxes on the left-hand-most column. You can select them individually, or click the checkbox in the header of the table (next to the word ‘Date’) to select all the products on the page. If you do that, another option will reveal itself, to allow you to “Select 50+” products. This will ignore the pagination and select all the products in your results. Click on Batch actions and select what you want to do. For example, you might want to create AIs for all your selected products, so select Create AIs. Another field pops up for you to give more information: in this case, which AI template you want to use. Click Run and the background task monitor (the bell at the top) will let you know when your zipped-up AIs are ready to download.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The available batch actions are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Run custom report</li>\r\n<li>Add to collection</li>\r\n<li>Create PDF catalogue</li>\r\n<li>Create single-product PDFs (AIs, press releases)</li>\r\n<li>Create multi-page PDFs (flyers etc)</li>\r\n<li>Run validations</li>\r\n<li>Create Export Batch (ONIX)</li>\r\n<li>Include in Shopify push</li>\r\n<li>Add to Export Batch</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>So for instance, if you wanted to download a Custom Report for all of your products, you would</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Go to the Product search page</li>\r\n<li>Select All: click the ‘select all’ checkbox at the top of the table.

Find the option which says Edition, in the section of the search form labelled “IS”. Whittle down your search further, as you wish, using pub date ranges, and perhaps putting “Status: Cancelled” in the “IS NOT” section. Hit Search when you’re ready.</p>\r\n<p>To save these records in a collection, click the select all checkbox, at the top of the table. This will automatically select the Select 50+ products box.</p>\r\n<p>Now click on the Batch Actions button. Select Add to a collection from the dropdown.

You can see those by going to Main menu > Workflow > Collections > ..of collections > Monthly publications. However, it isn’t practical for Bibliocloud to produce these groupings automatically at the imprint, category, user or other level because the navigation would get very cluttered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, to see your titles at a sub-grouped level, you can use the ‘Group By’ feature on the product search page. Go to Main menu > Publishing > Products > All. Use the Advanced search on that page to refine your search: e.g. from today’s date to 18 months hence, and choose your imprint.\r\nYou can add further filters e.g.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Not an ebook</li>\r\n<li>Not cancelled (which is there as default)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Click 'search' to get the results of your search.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, click the “Group by” button on the search page’s menu bar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Choose Imprint, Pub month or Edition, or another option. For example, if you want to see your books arranged into the months they’re published in, click Pub month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scan the results and see if that is how you’d like your data to be arranged. If it’s not, select a different option from the Group by button, such as Edition. Within the sub-groupings the data defaults to ordering by publication date. Next you can save the results of your search, so that you can access your titles arranged like this again without having to run the search again.

An <a href=\"http://www.digitalbookworld.com/2015/no-computer-system-can-fix-a-broken-publisher/\">article by Emma Barnes</a>, published in Digital Book World’s Expert Publishing blog, June 2015, lays out the process that we follow.</p>\r\n\t\t<h5>No computer system can fix a broken publisher</h5>\r\n\t\t<p>Before we get to talking about databases, metadata management, interfaces or legacy data migration, let's close the laptops, get out a Sharpie and some Post-It notes and talk about business process.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>The point at which a publishing business starts to think about putting in place a new management system is a great time for a spring-cleaning of its processes. In fact, whether a publisher realizes it or not, the reason they think they need a system is usually because of problems with process, not data.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>Yet that bigger picture rarely gets the level of scrutiny it deserves amid the daily hurly-burly of trying to keep a thousand tasks, deliverables and projects on track.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>When publishers take the time to reflect on how they work and how well it’s working, though, they tend to arrive at more intentional and efficient ideas about their workflows and processes. That’s why we encourage all our clients to let us facilitate a day’s workshop for them. At those workshops, in the morning, we document how things work in the business, right now, using Post-It notes and a big wall.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>We talk about how a publication gets from soup to nuts. We talk about how commissioning and acquisition works, about how the business considers and approves a manuscript put forward for consideration. We document how long the business allows for a book to go through its various stages of development. We write down all the discussions that have to occur and layers of approval that have to be passed—who’s involved and what each step is for. We write down all the names of the various documents that hold data. We articulate exactly how things normally happen to get a book to market in all its formats.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>Do you know who, for instance, is in charge of writing back-cover copy in your organization? And who then signs off on it? Do you pass it by the author for approval? Or to senior editors to make sure that an imprint-level view is taken? What about series editors—do they have a say?</p>\r\n\t\t<p>What about cost sign-offs—is there a stack of invoices waiting to be approved by senior managers? Can they see the context in which they’re signing them—whether they signify an overspend or are within budget—or is it just a pile of invoices needing signatures?</p>\r\n\t\t<p>How do you handle a project’s transmittal from editorial to production? How long do you allow for proofreading? Is your in-house design team actually capable of meeting the deadlines for first and final cover drafts that editorial assumes to be reasonable?</p>\r\n\t\t<p>What’s your canonical source of metadata? How many spreadsheets get maintained by different departments and individuals that contain roughly the same data?</p>\r\n\t\t<p>And what we always discover—without exaggeration — is that there’s a lot of duplication, and a lot of assumptions about who does what, and when.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>Lunch can be a sobering affair, during which the team may reflect, with some dismay, on their working practices. Don’t confuse that with snark; I would challenge any publisher to go through this exercise and feel that their workflow resembles a finely tuned machine.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>Things pick up throughout the afternoon of our workshop, though, as it’s our chance to redesign the process for the future. The bottlenecks and duplication of data and effort that seem so obvious after our morning’s work get eliminated from the plan. We have some great, spirited discussions about who, precisely, should do what. I often see real relief from people who’ve been living with the effects of a poorly articulated process, who see simplification and clarity on the horizon for the first time in years.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>It’s an exhausting day, as you can imagine, and sometimes it’s the first of many. But in time I email the team the first draft of their own \"Publishing Manual.\" It’s a document that, after many edits, refinements and discussions, will eventually be given to every new hire—\"this is how we do things here,\" with every part of the publishing process clearly written down. Responsibilities articulated, authority made clear. The roles of departments and individuals defined in writing. Timescales (both normal and crash schedules) laid out.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>The document names meetings, and their frequency, attendees and expected outcomes. It states how the team will manage the canonical version of every sort of data, from contacts and schedules to metadata and printer estimates.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>And almost as an afterthought, the Publishing Manual contains information about how the IT system will help—where the data will be entered and maintained, where meeting minutes will be captured and actioned, how sign-offs get stored and so on.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>Because configuring a system to support a particular process is the easy part. Figuring out what the process should look like, on the other hand, is the larger problem. It’s emotionally charged, challenging, difficult and often frustrating. But it’s necessary and, ultimately, hugely beneficial for the business.</p>\r\n\t\t<p>And it’s a prerequisite for the success of any significant systems implementation.</p>\r\n"], [37, "About Bibliocloud", "    <h4>System architecture</h4>\r\n    <p>Bibliocloud is a web-based application written using the renowned web\r\n    development framework Ruby on Rails. We regularly upgrade our code so that\r\n    it uses the most recent stable release. Bibliocloud’s data is stored in a\r\n    PostgreSQL database. Static assets, such as uploaded files, cover images,\r\n    production files and system-generated PDFs, are stored in the cloud.\r\n    Twitter, Hulu, Basecamp, Shopify, Github and the Yellow Pages are built in\r\n    Ruby on Rails.</p>\r\n    <h4>Hosting</h4>\r\n    <p>Bibliocloud is a web-based application, which means you can access it\r\n    anywhere, bringing immense business advantages and enabling greater levels\r\n    of flexibility and cost-reduction than the more traditional client-server\r\n    architecture allows. The Bibliocloud application code is hosted by Platform\r\n    as a Service provider Heroku, a massively scalable, high-performance cloud\r\n    platform.</p>\r\n    <p>Our Heroku service provides:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>Fully managed database service with automatic health checks</li>\r\n        <li>Write-ahead log (WAL) off-premise storage every 60 seconds,\r\n        ensuring minimal data loss in case of catastrophic failure</li>\r\n        <li>Daily logical database backups with PG Backups</li>\r\n        <li>Data clips for easy and secure sharing of data and queries</li>\r\n        <li>SSL-protected psql/libpq access</li>\r\n        <li>Running unmodified Postgres 9.3</li>\r\n        <li>Postgres extensions</li>\r\n        <li>A full-featured web UI</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p>We use Heroku’s Standard Tier which is designed for production\r\n    applications. Our usual database provision allows for:</p>\r\n    <ul>\r\n        <li>No row limitations</li>\r\n        <li>Increasing amounts of in-memory cache</li>\r\n        <li>Fork and follow support</li>\r\n        <li>Rollback</li>\r\n        <li>Database metrics published to application log stream for further\r\n        analysis</li>\r\n        <li>Priority service restoration on disruptions</li>\r\n        <li>Cache Size: 1GB</li>\r\n        <li>Storage limit: 1TB (data only, not files)</li>\r\n        <li>Connection limit: 120</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n    <p>More documentation is available <a href=\r\n    \"https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/how-heroku-works\">here</a></p>\r\n    <p>You can theoretically host Bibliocloud locally if you provide the\r\n    technical support and maintain your own hardware. However, the costs of\r\n    skilled personnel and infrastructure requirements that you would incur –\r\n    which Heroku provide for a fraction of the cost and at a much higher level\r\n    of competence than any in-house IT team or IT outsourced service provider\r\n    can be expected to achieve – mean that local hosting would add tens,\r\n    possibly hundreds, of thousands of pounds onto a Bibliocloud installation.\r\n    For that reason we do not recommend or support in-house hosting.</p>\r\n    <h4>Our suppliers</h4>\r\n    <p>Heroku are owned by the very large Salesforce.com. Heroku use Amazon’s\r\n    EC2 servers for storage, and we specifically use their EU datacenter in\r\n    Ireland. The proximity of Ireland to the majority of our customers shaves a few milliseconds off each\r\n    request. Both static assets and the database itself are in the EU: the\r\n    system uploads assets such as image files and PDFs to Amazon’s S3\r\n    service.</p>\r\n    <p>Amazon’s cloud storage services are world-class, well-maintained and\r\n    used globally, even by their direct competitors such as Netflix.</p>\r\n    <h4>Scalability</h4>\r\n    <p>The Standard Tier is one of Heroku’s most basic plans. When our data and\r\n    capacity requirements increase, Heroku can offer seven more levels of\r\n    Standard Tier provisioning, up to 120GB cache, 1TB storage and 500\r\n    connections. After that, Heroku provide a subsequent Premium Tier.</p>\r\n    <p>Bibliocloud, with its Heroku hosting, is highly scalable. To understand\r\n    why, you need to know about dynos. A dyno is a lightweight linux container\r\n    that runs a single user-specified command and Heroku charge for the use of\r\n    them. Web dynos receive HTTP traffic from Heroku’s routers and run the\r\n    various commands that users request when they’re using Bibliocloud. Worker\r\n    dynos are typically used for background jobs, queueing, and timed jobs. A\r\n    typical Bibliocloud installation, servicing 100 users and containing 10\r\n    years of publishing data, will use 2 web dynos and 1 worker dyno. This can\r\n    be increased dynamically to 100 web and 100 worker dynos on our existing\r\n    ‘basic’ plan.</p>\r\n    <h4>Platform</h4>\r\n    <p>Because Bibliocloud is effectively a website, it doesn’t matter what\r\n    computer platform or device you use. Bibliocloud runs in any modern web\r\n    browser such as Chrome, Firefox, Opera, IE and Safari, on any platform,\r\n    such as Windows, Linux and OSX, on any computer or device, such as Mac, PC,\r\n    tablet and laptop.</p>"], [7, "Your publishing list", "<p>One of the main uses of spreadsheets in a publisher is to keep track of the forward schedule: the list of books coming out in the next 12-18 months and beyond.</p>\r\n<p>Instead of having these spreadsheets -- where data is inconsistent and un-synchronised across departments -- use Bibliocloud as your single source of truth.</p>\r\n<p>On the main menu, click on <code>Publishing > Products >List overview</code>.

The plan itself is subject to planning, as we tailor it to your particular business objectives, workflow, budget, timescales, legacy data quality and functionality requirements. It’s something of a starter for ten, at least.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Planning tools</h4>\r\n<p>We use <a href=\"http://asana.com\">Asana</a> for our planning. Email is the worst way to run an implementation project — it’s not actionable, and important details get lost in long email threads. Asana is a place for us to keep files, notes, lists of data and tasks with their owners and deadlines, so we all know what’s going on. You’ll get an invite to the project team’s page when we kick off the project. Asana is free for up to 15 team members.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Pre-Implementation</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>After the workflow workshop, we plunge into the implementation project itself. Here's what that can look like. The first stage is to write up a plan. </p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Write functionality spec</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>What do you need the system to do?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ideally this task will produce an Excel spreadsheet with detailed functionality broken down into the main areas that you require e.g. ‘metadata and ONIX’, ‘production’, ‘AI production’, ‘permissions’, with an indication of how important the functionality is to current and future business priorities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Output: an Excel spreadsheet of your functional requirements</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Review functionality spec</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>We review your requirements. This helps us to see what your priorities are, and to identify any gaps which we can plug with code development. (We don’t charge for this code development, obviously.)</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Pre-Implementation Planning Meeting</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>An important meeting at which we agree the order that functionality should be rolled out. We agree the general scope of the entire project, and agree what is and is not in scope. We set the date for the metadata go-live, and the date for the phase 2 planning meeting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Output: minutes of the meeting include agreement on dates and go-live functionality, and the scope of the entire project.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Identify Paper-Based Processes</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>We need to discover all the places that you keep data, which can include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Notes jotted down in editorial meetings</li>\r\n<li>post-it reminders</li>\r\n<li>printed out publication schedules</li>\r\n<li>printed out and annotated lists of ISBNs from Nielsen.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Output: A record of paper-based processes, and examples.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Identify Excel Or Homegrown Db-Based Processes</h5>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Excel, Access, Filemaker, Sharepoint.</li>\r\n<li>Are in-house invoices raised on excel?</li>\r\n<li>Is the production schedule run on excel spreadsheets? Budgetting? Production scheduling? Royalties?</li>\r\n<li>Mailing lists?</li>\r\n<li>Gratis books sent out?</li>\r\n<li>Reviewcopy tracker?</li>\r\n<li>ISBN13s from Nielsen?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Output: a record of Excel-based processes, and zip file of examples.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Collect Main Spreadsheets And Templates</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Address book: Contacts</li>\r\n<li>Royalties: Royalty payments, Advance payments, Royalty rates</li>\r\n<li>Production: Printer invoices</li>\r\n<li>Editorial origination invoices (typesetters, proofreaders)</li>\r\n<li>Legal: Boilerplate head contract Boilerplate rights contract</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Output: a collection of examples.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Identify Main Flows Of Data</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Which information goes from you to other companies, and vice versa? e.g.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>ONIX to Nielsen, Bowker, BDS, Gardners, Amazon</li>\r\n<li>ONIX to Nielsen, Bowker, BDS, Gardners, Amazon -- Price updates to distributor</li>\r\n<li>Sales from distributor</li>\r\n<li>Sales from ebook aggregators</li>\r\n<li>Royalty statements to authors</li>\r\n<li>Rights statements from foreign publishers - …/</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Output: Description of what information goes where, when and in what format. Files should be collected if the layout and format of the data is important e.g. retailer spreadsheets</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Store Examples And Summary Report</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Write a summary of your findings so far on Asana.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h5>Data Cleansing And Feedback</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>We look at your data, clean and tidy it and advise on any major issues. Often we’ll send it back to you for you to tidy, then back to us for another round. If the data is too poor quality to ever be processable, we will tell you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Major Functionality Gap Analysis</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>From the client functionality spec, identify any major gaps.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Bespoke Importer Scripts</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have sent us any files in a format that we cannot parse out of the box, we’ll write scripts specifically to ingest your data. Bibliocloud can parse as a matter of routine ONIX 2.1 long tag messages, and various spreadsheets.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Agree Canonical Source Of Shared Data</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>If data will be stored on two systems, which system is the data owner? e.g. Distributor should be the owner of stock and availability data, publisher should be the owner of product metadata. Agree how the data will flow between partners: ONIX, API calls, or, heavens forfend, email. We are pragmatic — if we have to conform to your partners’ lack of system sophistication, we will — but we’ll counsel folk to improve their infrastructure to make it as robust as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Bespoke Marketing Materials Development</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>We take an example of one of your Advance Information sheets and use it to write code that will allow you to export your AIs from Bibliocloud, in the format you’re used to.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4> Metadata Implementation</h4>\r\n\r\n<h5>Order Test Metadata From Nielsen</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather than using your own in-house metadata, we like to buy it back from Nielsen or your local data aggregator. It makes for an interesting audit of your current data — a good idea, whilst you’re looking at systems and changing processes. So at this stage we place an order with Nielsen for your metadata. They tend to take around 10-20 days and it costs around £200 to £1000 depending on your size.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Metadata Production At Nielsen</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Nielsen send a sample metadata set back, generally around 10-20 working days after ordering it. We load it into a development system and analyse it to judge the data quality and draw up a preliminary list of data cleansing tasks that will be required for the full data set.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Load Nielsen Test Data To Production System</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>We create an account on the production system and load the data. Data cleansing routines are run to ensure that only the appropriate prices and suppliers are present. This import takes about an hour for 5000 titles, mainly because the 50mb file takes a while to upload to the internet.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Check data</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>After the initial check of data upon import, we spend time running further tests on the Nielsen data we’ve imported and come back to you with queries. These tests are so that we can go back to Nielsen with any queries or error reports.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Initial training on test system</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>We tend to make the system available to a few key users at this point, to start the familiarisation process and to aid with error correction on the Nielsen data.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Order confirmed metadata from Nielsen</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Payment of GBP550+vat due to Nielsen from client. Nielsen include covers in the same price as the data, although they’re so low resolution as to be useless, but we import these as well as a fallback.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Full metadata returned from Nielsen: import</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>We load the data to a development system and develop data cleansing routines in consultation with the client. Typically we would send a list of the types of price, formats, suppliers etc. with recommendations for data cleansing and requests for guidance. Our tests at this stage are qualitative and include such things as contact duplication (more than one author records with similar names which would suggest a typo in the Nielsen data), imprints with similar names, multiple prices for channels we weren’t aware you ship to and so on. We will share the burden of correcting this data – we batch-fix errors which can be best fixed programmatically, and you manually fix smaller errors. This is a useful aid to training and starts to make the system come alive.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Provide unallocated ISBN list</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>You send us your list of ISBNs that you’ve previously bought from Nielsen and not yet allocated to any products.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Import unallocated ISBN list</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>We validate the ISBNs to check they are valid, and do not currently exist in Bibliocloud for previous published products.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Go-live and training</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>When the loaded data has been vetted, and cover images etc. are loaded (by us), we can run a one day training course on the common functionality for navigating and basic use of the system. We then start the process of getting an ONIX data feed accepted by Nielsen, which tends to take around 2-3 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Charges</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>GBP600+VAT for each training day</li>\r\n<li>GBP600+VAT for data management and load</li>\r\n<li>All parts of the system are available from the start. The main point here is that all functionality is available from Day 0, but not all your legacy data, or training in every aspect of the system. We focus in Phase 1 on metadata, both the legacy data itself and its management.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h5> Usual capabilities as of go-live</h5>\r\n\r\n<h4>Titles:</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Creation of new titles and products, and maintenance of marketing texts, prices, cover images and other metadata</li>\r\n<li>Metadata quality validation against BIC excellence</li>\r\n<li>Basic data management capabilities including spell-check, word and character counts,</li>\r\n<li>Audit trail</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Production:</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Forecasting print spend</li>\r\n<li>Capturing specs for future orders and producing print orders in PDF</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Marketing:</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Creation and export of AIs</li>\r\n<li>Creation and export of Catalogue XML, and use of boiler-plate XML design template</li>\r\n<li>Amazon title checker</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Agreements:</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Development and use of contracts for new titles</li>\r\n<li>New rights enquiries, deals and permissions management</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Workflow:</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Use of schedules, collections, projects, pipelines for task management</li>\r\n<li>Use of acquisition process & P&L for new titles.</li>\r\n<li>Peer review and copy tracking.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h5>Other activities:</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<li>Existing contact data to be uploaded, dependent on suitability and data quality.</li>\r\n<li>Existing contract upload of pdf/doc.</li>\r\n<li>Establishing definitions of the client’s editions and formats, for back-populating existing metadata and use on new products and titles.</li>\r\n<li>ONIX transmission will be pending approval by Nielsen</li>\r\n<li>Sales and royalties will be de-prioritised until the publishing process is established.</li>\r\n<li>Historical rights agreements to be considered for upload if appropriate format and data quality can be established.</li>\r\n<li>Further refinement of processes based on feedback from the client.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Getting to know Bibliocloud</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>We plan for a higher number of support queries than usual, as people spend their first weeks using the system. We actively encourage as many support queries as possible to encourage people to ask questions as they learn the system. This is a great time to get to know these help pages.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Rethink any processes which we know can be improved now we have Bibliocloud</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>It's much easier to have thoughts about in-house processes once you have the basic system up and running and you can see how Bibliocloud can help. This is a good opportunity to have a further planning meeting to discuss any improvements that have come to light during the project so far. For instance:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Who is responsible for the presence and quality of metadata.</li>\r\n<li>How did our data get to Nielsen, and what errors has that introduced? What do we have to do now to stop it happening again e.g. stop your distributor from sending their own hand-keyed version of your metadata.</li>\r\n<li>How are permissions managed</li>\r\n<li>How are royalties run</li>\r\n<li>How are rights statements chased in</li>\r\n<li>How do we run our acquisitions process</li>\r\n<li>How do we match POs against budgeted spend</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>We use this thought-process in the second planning meeting, to follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Publisher’s data validation</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>At this stage, it's good to review the use of Nielsen data on an AI layout, and review the quality of data imported from Nielsen’s ONIX:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Titles. Is the title exactly as it’s printed on the book?</li>\r\n<li>Covers. Are the rights ones attached to the right editions?</li>\r\n<li>Contributor names. Correct spelling and layout? Only one author record per actual person or organisation? - Contributor roles - Blurb - Subject codes. Correct?</li>\r\n<li>Editions. Are all the editions of the title there e.g. ebook, hardback, school edition?

It is an excellent training follow-up exercise to enter these titles by hand, provided there are fewer than 25 of them. If there are more than 25, we will import the difference automatically from a Google sheet template.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h5>Schedule planning</h5>\r\n<p>Now's the time to write up schedules and their tasks, if that wasn't completed before go-live.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>PHASE 2 PLANNING</h4>\r\n\r\n<h5>Write up internal review notes</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a good point to write up lessons learned so far.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Planning day</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>This second planning day comes after people have been using the system for a few weeks, who now have hands-on experience of the system and an insight into how processes can be improved and data managed better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This planning meeting has two aims:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>To understand what business processes need to change to make the company run more smoothly</li>\r\n<li>To scope out the rollout of further functionality</li>\r\n<li>To make a plan to resolve lessons learned so far. E.g. is there rights / production etc data which is in too poor a state to use? Do we still like the AI template we’re using?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h5>Missing fields</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Using the system might have flushed out areas where additional fields and functionality could be helpful. Let us know and we can add it to the roadmap.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Data transfer</h5>\r\n<p>Non-vital data transfer requirements tend to get configured after the initial metadata go-live. We identify reports which are required by the system that don’t currently exist. Often we can see that a report isn’t necessary. What decisions are being made from the report? Who is the recipient and what do they do with it, or need it for? Should the recipient actually be accessing the data directly from Bibliocloud?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the report is, in fact, necessary, can it be delivered in a more automated way e.g. API call rather than CSV download.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also identify data which will be flowing in from third parties. Bibliocloud can handle a large range of incoming data: any additional data will need to have an import, written by us. Examples are distributor sales files, price changes from ebook aggregators, licensed rights contracts, sales from the customer facing website. </p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Phase 2 go live and training</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>The usual capabilities as of Phase 2 go-live will be:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Royalty management</li>\r\n<li>Schedules from your templates</li>\r\n<li>Contracts from your templates</li>\r\n<li>As much legacy data as we are able to parse</li>\r\n<li>Regular ONIX feed to Nielsen, Amazon et al</li>\r\n<li>Rights able to use the system to access past deals</li>\r\n<li>Sales files imported on a regular basis from distributors</li>\r\n<li>Sales files imported on a regular basis from distributors</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Items which are usually still out of scope for Phase 2, and to be investigated for phase 3, are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>API integration with customer facing website, dependent on your website provider</li>\r\n<li>XML print orders to new printers</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Shopify</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>If you need a customer-facing website, it might be a good idea to consider creating it as part of this wider systems project.

We’ve always been very interested in the business side of publishing – about being more efficient and canny than others. This philosophy pretty soon gave us a high profile. We won a Nibbie, then another one, then an IPA award too. Later, our books started to win prizes, too, and our high profile garnered us various exciting invitations, including a trip to the Palace to meet the Queen.</p>\r\n<p>Our efficiency has been made possible by our technological skill. We are publishers-turned-Ruby on Rails developers, after a decade of automating away the drudge, specializing in web application development and database optimization. The combination of sleek technological efficiency and solid creative excellence is, for us, as potent and heady a combination as it’s ever been. And in 2013, Bibliocloud won us the Futurebook Best Technology Innovation award.</p>\r\n<p>One of our strongest points of competitive advantage is that we use our own software. As our own harshest critics, we buff and polish Bibliocloud’s functionality until it matches our own stringent requirements, as busy and nimble trade publishers. Over the last four years we have worked closely with non-trade clients, particularly co-edition and illustrated publishers, adding to the system’s functionality to ensure that Bibliocloud has the broadest functional fit and appeal.</p>\r\n<p>In Spring 2014 we embarked on a complete redesign of Bibliocloud’s front end user interface, ready for the next major release launch of Bibliocloud Version 4, which was in April 2015 at the London Book Fair.</p>\r\n<p>In Autumn 2015 we were shortlisted for the Futurebook Digital Achiever award. Our Manifesto for the Future of the Book  -- on the need for technical skills in junior publishing roles -- was selected out of more than 30 contributions to be delivered at the Futurebook conference 2015.</p>\r\n<p>Read our writing for Futurebook and Digital Book World on our blog: www.coderead.co</p>\r\n<h4>The team</h4>\r\n<p>General Products Ltd is run by its CEO, Emma Barnes. Rob Jones is our Chairman, and David Aldridge is our Data Architect.</p>\r\n<p>Emma has spent ten years at the helm of the award-winning independent trade publisher Snowbooks, which she co-founded with Rob. She uses her pragmatic understanding of the realities of modern publishing to ensure Bibliocloud provides the best functional fit and design. She is expert in Ruby on Rails, XSLT, XML, HTML5, CSS3 and InDesign.</p>\r\n<p>Prior to co-founding Snowbooks, Emma acquired extensive experience in buying, supply chain, business analysis, store management, merchandising and cost reduction both as a retail manager and consultant at Kingfisher (Superdrug, B&Q, and on secondment to Procter and Gamble), and Deloitte (on projects including supply chain optimisation, buying and procurement, and M&A, with clients including BP, New Look, Prudential, Transport for London and the MOD, and with technology including SAP and Retek). She holds an undergraduate degree in archaeology and a graduate diploma from Oxford University in business management. She is an associate lecturer on the Publishing undergraduate course at Oxford Brookes university and a frequent guest speaker at universities and events including Radio 4’s Today programme, the Festival of Publishing, Publish Scotland’s digital seminar and Railsgirls London. She regularly writes articles for publications including Digital Book World, Publishers Weekly, The Bookseller’s Futurebook and The Guardian.</p>\r\n<p>Rob co-founded Snowbooks and General Products with Emma after many years in industry and strategic consulting, with clients that included First Quench and with various roles in business planning at the Kingfisher group. He is an author of fiction and non-fiction and a programmer in a number of languages including Ruby and Javascript. He holds a physics degree as well as a biotechnology and bioinformatics graduate degree.</p>\r\n<p>David is a multi-skilled software development professional with business domain experience in publishing, utilities, defence, marketing, logistics, media and finance. He has over fifteen years of in-depth technical experience in Oracle data warehousing, Business Objects, and Informatica and SQL-based ETL, with a long-term career shift towards data and system architecture and web application development with Ruby on Rails. Specialties include high performance and flexible data architecture, based on a theoretically sound and pragmatic approach to design, and in-depth knowledge of relational database architecture. He has a deep technical understanding of Oracle and PostgreSQL methods and features. David was recognised with a Oracle ACE award in 2007.</p>\r\n<p>Emma and David run the Try Programming course – an introductory Ruby on Rails course tailored specifically to publishers, on behalf of the Oxford Publishing Group and the Publishing department at Oxford Brookes University.</p>\r\n<h4>The business</h4>\r\n<p>General Products Ltd is privately owned and funded.

Sometimes that'll be an Excel spreadsheet. Other times it'll be a nicely-laid-out AI PDF, or a catalogue. But if we're sending data to other players in the publishing supply chain, we'll want to send data in the ONIX format. This article introduces ONIX and XML so you know what we're talking about.</p>\r\n<h4>About XML</h4>\r\n<p>XML is one of those boring ideas that can make business run more smoothly, like ISBN numbers or barcodes. Really it&rsquo;s just some general rules for how to write down information so that computers as well as people can read it &ndash; mainly computers, though. It&rsquo;s not even a full set of rules; it&rsquo;s just enough to help people make a start on designing their own formats for sharing information.</p>\r\n<p>So in publishing, people have taken the XML rules and added some extra, book-specific ones until they came up with a standardised way for describing new titles &ndash; or old ones, for that matter. The standardisation makes it easy for the whole industry to share information. Publishers can tell all the book stores, book clubs, library services and industry databases about a new title by sending them all a copy of the same XML file. In other sectors, XML is being used as the starting point for storing a multitude of different types of information. There are XML standards for creating an invoice or describing a gene - or (to return to publishing) to store the contents of an e-book in a standardised way.</p>\r\n<h4>The guts of XML (made palatable for non-techies)</h4>\r\n<p>This might not be scintillating information, but it&rsquo;s easy enough to learn.</p>\r\n<p>The first thing to learn about XML is good news: it&rsquo;s written in English. Or rather it&rsquo;s written using ordinary words, with a few squiggles added, and not in some sort of computer hieroglyphics.</p>\r\n<p>So, imagine you&rsquo;re sending out details of a new book you&rsquo;re publishing. Naturally you want everyone to add its details to their stock systems so they can easily order it. Let&rsquo;s start with the title, The Life and Times of Ned Lud. A human being can take a guess that it&rsquo;s a book title, but in XML you always label information to make it clear. So we might write this:</p>\r\n<code>&lt;TitleText&gt;The Life and Times of Ned Lud&lt;/TitleText&gt;</code>\r\n<p> It&rsquo;s like that maxim for lecturing: tell people what you&rsquo;re going to say, then say it, then tell them what you just said. So that line above says: Here comes something called TitleText, &lsquo;The Life and Times of Ned Lud&rsquo;, that&rsquo;s the end of the TitleText. When you put &lsquo;/&rsquo; in front of a label you&rsquo;re marking the end of something.</p>\r\n<p>Of course you can make up your own names for information. You could choose <NameOfBook> or <FieldDD6_Alpha_Gobbledygook>, but it just so happens that <TitleText> is the name that&rsquo;s been agreed on by largish group of book publishers as part of the ONIX standard. The bit in the angle brackets is called a &lsquo;tag&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s fairly easy to see why; you &lsquo;tag&rsquo; information to say what it means. For instance, if all you have is the piece of text &lsquo;Winston Churchill&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s difficult to tell whether that&rsquo;s a book about him or a book written by him &ndash; both are plausible. So everything gets tagged for clarity&rsquo;s sake. Take a look at this:</p>\r\n<pre>\r\n&lt;Author>Katie Daynes&lt;/Author&gt;\r\n&lt;TitleText>Winston Churchill&lt;/TitleText&gt;\r\n&lt;ISBN>074606814X&lt;/ISBN&gt;\r\n&lt;Publisher>Usborne Publishing Ltd&lt;/Publisher&gt;\r\n</pre>\r\n<p>Hopefully it&rsquo;s pretty obvious what that all means. Each &lsquo;tag&rsquo; has a start and an end and the bit in the middle is the information you want to share &ndash; also known as the &lsquo;contents&rsquo; of the tag. A computer can easily read it and so can a person (with a little effort). Unfortunately for us, information about books gets complicated and so the XML used to store it has to get complicated too.</p>\r\n<p>For instance, what do we do if there&rsquo;s more than one author? Or if there&rsquo;s no author, just an editor and some contributors? And what about all the other pieces of information we might want to share, like publication date, price and distributor details? The people who wrote ONIX came up with something that&rsquo;s not exactly perfect, but it does allow you store a vast amount of information about a title in a structured way.</p>\r\n<p>One feature of XML the ONIX designers made use of was the idea of putting one tag inside another. I want to show you what that looks like, but real ONIX documents are a bit difficult to read, so this next example is just a made-up one; it doesn&rsquo;t follow the ONIX standard. But on the plus side, it&rsquo;s actually possible for a human to understand it.</p>\r\n<pre>\r\n&lt;Book&gt;  \r\n   &lt;Title&gt;  \r\n       &lt;MainTitle&gt;The Life and Times of Ned Lud&lt;/MainTitle&gt;  \r\n       &lt;SubTitle&gt;Backward Looking Visionary&lt;/SubTitle&gt;  \r\n   &lt;/Title&gt;  \r\n   &lt;Author&gt;  \r\n       &lt;FirstName&gt;Emma&lt;/FirstName&gt;  \r\n       &lt;Surname&gt;Barnes&lt;/Surname&gt;  \r\n   &lt;/Author&gt;  \r\n   &lt;Illustrator&gt;  \r\n       &lt;FirstName&gt;Rob&lt;/FirstName&gt;  \r\n       &lt;Surname&gt;Jones&lt;/Surname&gt;  \r\n   &lt;/Illustrator&gt; \r\n&lt;/Book&gt;\r\n</pre>\r\n<p> So in this made-up example, if a <Surname> tag is inside an <Author> tag, then it&rsquo;s the name of an Author; if it&rsquo;s inside an <Illustrator> tag, then it&rsquo;s the name of an illustrator.</p>\r\n<p>Easy.</p>\r\n<p>Amazingly, we&rsquo;re nearly finished, but there&rsquo;s another XML feature we need to cover first. It&rsquo;s called an attribute. The idea of an attribute is to let you add some additional information about a tag. Let&rsquo;s imagine no one liked the last excerpt so we went away and came up with a new XML format for describing books and it looked like this.</p>\r\n<pre>\r\n&lt;Book&gt;  \r\n    &lt;Title type='Main'&gt; The Life and Times of Ned Lud&lt;Title&gt;  \r\n    &lt;Title type='Subtitle'&gt;Backward Looking Visionary&lt;Title&gt;\r\n    &lt;Person role='Author'&gt;Emma Barnes&lt;/Person&gt;  \r\n    &lt;Person role='Illustrator'&gt;Rob Jones&lt;/Person&gt; \r\n&lt;Book&gt; \r\n</pre>\r\n<p>Again, it&rsquo;s not what the real ONIX standard looks like; ONIX is rather confusing. This is just a made up format. It conveys pretty much the same information as the last excerpt, but instead of putting one tag inside another to spell out its meaning we&rsquo;re adding extra info inside the angle brackets.</p>\r\n<p>XML gives you the scope to choose either of them as your standard; it&rsquo;s up to you which you prefer.</p>\r\n<p>OK. So there&rsquo;s lots more you could learn about XML, but that&rsquo;s enough so you can join in fun dinner party conversations on the subject and look techies in the eye without flinching. Let&rsquo;s get back to the real world of publishing.</p>\r\n<h4>The ONIX Standard</h4>\r\n<p>If you want an easy way to tell Nielsen or Amazon or Waterstones about a new book, you can put all the relevant info in an ONIX message and e-mail or FTP it to them. In case you&rsquo;re interested, the British contributors to the ONIX standard were the BIC, made up of the Library Association, The British Library, The Booksellers Association and The Publishers Association, so it&rsquo;s got some weight behind it.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a gigantic and complicated standard because it needs to be able to hold gigantic and complicated amounts of information for each title. For instance, it gives you tags for listing the back cover quotes on your book, and giving the names of each quote contributor and the organisations they work for. It lets you include details of discounts and promotions by date and region. It holds information on formats and rights and physical dimensions &ndash; and even what units the measurements are being given in.</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately for anyone who wants to open an ONIX message and actually read the contents, the standard also makes use of numbers where a name would have been easier to read. For instance, if you want to know whether a book has been published yet you could look at the tag. Here&rsquo;s one:</p>\r\n<code>&lt;PublishingStatus&gt;04&lt;/PublishingStatus&gt; </code>\r\n<p>But what does &lsquo;04&rsquo; mean? Well, if you hunt down a copy of the ONIX documentation you&rsquo;ll find this list:</p>\r\n<h4>List 64: Publishing status</h4>\r\n<table class='table table-bordered'>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Value</th>\r\n<th>Description</th>\r\n<th>Notes</th>\r\n<th>Issue number</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>00</td>\r\n<td>Unspecified</td>\r\n<td>Status is not specified (as distinct from unknown): the default if the &lt;PublishingStatus&gt; element is not sent.

Code 06 does not specifically imply that returns are or are not still accepted.</td>\r\n<th>9</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>07</td>\r\n<td>Out of print</td>\r\n<td>The product was active, but is now permanently inactive in the sense that (a) the publisher will not accept orders for it, though stock may still be available elsewhere in the supply chain, and (b) the product will not be made available again under the same ISBN.

It may be available to be traded through another channel. A Publishing Status code 10 ‘Remaindered’ usually but not always means that the publisher has decided to sell off excess inventory of the book. Copies of books that are remaindered are often made available in the supply chain at a reduced price. However, such remainders are often sold under a product identifier that differs from the ISBN on the full-priced copy of the book. A Publishing Status code 10 ‘Remaindered’ on a given product record may or may not be followed by a Publishing Status code 06 ‘Out of Stock Indefinitely’ or 07 ‘Out of Print’: the practise varies from one publisher to another. Some publishers may revert to a Publishing Status code 04 “Active” if a desired inventory level on the product in question has subsequently been reached. No change in rights should ever be inferred from this (or any other) Publishing Status code value.</td>\r\n<th>3</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>11</td>\r\n<td>Withdrawn from sale</td>\r\n<td>Withdrawn, typically for legal reasons or to avoid giving offence.</td>\r\n<th>9</th>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>12</td>\r\n<td>Recalled</td>\r\n<td>Recalled for reasons of consumer safety.

There are 102 of these lists explaining what the various different numbers and codes mean, so while humans can get the gist of what&rsquo;s in an ONIX message, the details are often hard to follow. The ONIX people could have chosen to use the words &lsquo;Active&rsquo; and &lsquo;Remaindered&rsquo; instead of the numbers &lsquo;04&rsquo; and &lsquo;10&rsquo;, but they probably took the view that machines, rather than people, would be reading these messages and numbers were more concise.</p>\r\n<h4>How can I use ONIX?</h4>\r\n<p>Having established that ONIX messages are swines to read &ndash; unless you&rsquo;re a machine &ndash; the obvious thing to do is enlist the help of a machine whenever you want to work with ONIX.</p>\r\n<p>Bibliocloud makes up ONIX messages. Instead of us looking up what all the tags and numbers mean, the software does that. The website gives you helpful forms to fill out; they list the available options in words. Then the program inserts the relevant code on your behalf. So if you choose &lsquo;Paperback&rsquo; from the drop-down list, the program puts the code &lsquo;BC&rsquo; into your ONIX message, saving you the bother of looking it up. (If we actually had to write ONIX messages by hand, we probably wouldn&rsquo;t bother.)</p>\r\n<p>You send ONIX from Bibliocloud to anyone you like: Nielsen, Bowker, Amazon and so on. You can also download it if you want to import it into other programs such as InDesign.</p>\r\n"], [20, "Bibliocloud as a DAM", "<p>You can upload and manage your production files in Bibliocloud.

If you&rsquo;re interested in how that works, the files are uploaded directly to the Amazon S3 cloud storage service which we use, not to the Bibliocloud app. This means that the upload is as fast as your internet connection allows, and is not hampered by any processing or intermediary systems. All the processing happens after the files are uploaded, not during.</p>\r\n<div class =\"bs-callout bs-callout-info\"><h4>Should you use cloud storage for large files?</h4><p> Using any website on a poor, slow internet connection can be trying, but is not impossible. However, using the a poor internet connection to upload files which are several hundreds of megabytes in size can be unworkable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have a slow internet connection and files routinely take more than an hour to upload, then we would counsel against using remote storage of any type &ndash; whether that&rsquo;s Bibliocloud or another cloud storage provider such as Dropbox or Box.net. Uploading and retrieving files, whilst they can run in the background, will take too long and the effect will be that users will feel disinclined to store files properly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are forced into using local storage, then you can store the local network location of your files within Bibliocloud. Note that if a user enters a link to a file on their local machine, other users in the company won&rsquo;t be able to access the file.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>You can upload any sort of file from the &lsquo;Import images and files&rsquo; page, such as Excel files, PDF scans of contracts, ePub files and even native InDesign and Photoshop production files. You can load large files one at a time, or many at a time. There are a few restrictions, though. Each file should only be 6mb or under in size. And the total number of files you can upload at any one time is limited. If you need to upload more files than you&rsquo;re allowed, repeat the upload process for batches of files. If you need either of these restrictions lifted, contact us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You need to remain on the same page whilst your upload is taking place. If you&rsquo;d like to continue using the system, open up a different browser: if you&rsquo;re using Chrome, then open a Firefox or a Safari browser. Sign in with your ususal credentials. You&rsquo;ll be able to use the system as normal until your uploads are complete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click on the &lsquo;Browse&rsquo; button and navigate to your files. You can select multiple files at a time by holding down the Ctrl (PC) or Cmd (Mac) key.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once your file or files are uploaded, you can match them to the relevant record in Bibliocloud &ndash; click on the link at the foot of the bulk uploader page marked &lsquo;Go to the Production Files area to allocate non-ISBN JPG files to the right work and books after upload is complete&rsquo; to do that. However, there&rsquo;s a short cut for cover images. If they are .jpg files, and if you name them with the ISBN13 of the product, then the system will automatically match them to their product. So, for instance, the file might be called 9781905005123.jpg. You don&rsquo;t need to do anything else to associate the cover with the product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve selected your files, click &lsquo;Start uploading&rsquo;. The files will upload one at a time, and you&rsquo;ll be able to see each file&rsquo;s progress by watching the progress bars. If you want to cancel the upload, click &lsquo;Cancel&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n"], [55, "Works list", "<p>Each heading in this section corresponds with a heading in the Publishing section of Bibliocloud: click on Main menu > Publishing to see. We’ll be looking at Works, Products, Prices, Production, Agreements, Royalties, Marketing and Performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first option on the Main menu is the Work search, followed by Product search. To understand the difference between a work and a product in Bibliocloud, let’s talk about how Bibliocloud structures its data. I know! Thrills! But persevere: it’ll come in very useful and save you time.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class =\"bs-callout bs-callout-success\"><h4>Works and products</h4>\r\n<p>You don’t want to have to type lots of identical data for the hardback, the paperback and the ebook versions of your title – that would be awful. Subjects, blurbs, author details – they’re all pretty much the same for each product and you’ll be typing data forever. And when any of that data changes, you don’t want to have to change it three times...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So to save you the bother, Bibliocloud is structured so that you can share data across similar products. To do this, Bibliocloud has the concept of works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Think of it as a family tree. Each work has one or more child products. A work is a body of writing. You can't sell a copy of it -- it’s the writing itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, a product is the physical or digital manifestation of that work: a thing you can sell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So you might refer to the work ‘Swann’s Way’, which might have five products: an illustrated slipcase edition, a hardback, a paperback, an eBook and an iOS app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we’re talking more generically about either a work or a product, we might use the word “title”. “Bibliocloud is a title management system”, that sort of thing.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>What's in a name?</h4>\r\n<p>You wouldn’t believe the hours that we at Bibliocloud Towers have spent agonising over what to call ‘works’ and ‘products’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Originally, we called the individual things that we sell a ‘book’. But what’s a ‘book’? A single copy? A publication? A piece of writing? Does the word encompass format, or is it more a description of the manuscript? Would you say that the hardback and the paperback are both ‘the book’?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If ‘book’ is too woolly, then what about splitting out the piece of writing from the physical form? Bibliographic folk would describe the ‘work’ and its ‘manifestations’, with ‘impressions’ (or printings) producing ‘items’. (The poor chaps who have to think about musical works and their performance aspect also have to consider ‘expressions’ of a work). This is very good, but the word ‘manifestation’ doesn’t really conjure up the image of a book. If a fellow in the street was to brandish a brown paper bag at you and declare ‘in this bag is my latest manifestation’, you’d not be entirely sure whether to reach for a pen, to get him to sign the article, or a strait-jacket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we can look at the words that non-bibliographic people frequently use to describe books. Why, they’d say, it’s simple. You have a paperback edition of a work, and a hardback. Aha! ‘Edition’. Sounds plausible. But that word is one of the most loaded. You can have a paperback edition (a format descriptor), or a second edition (a time descriptor), or the Penguin edition (a publisher descriptor) or the library edition (a customer descriptor), or the US edition (a territory descriptor). And what if you have the ‘digital edition’ which turns out to actually be three ‘books’: ePub, PDF and Mobi format?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What are the other options available to clearly describe a book? We’ve tried ‘edition’, ‘book’ and ‘manifestation’. Then there’s ‘product’, ‘ISBN’, ‘version’, ‘SKU’, ‘line’, ‘article’, ‘publication’, ‘format’. Amazon refer to ‘books’ and ‘formats’. Some bibliographic systems refer to ‘works’ and ‘editions’. The powers that be call them ‘works’ and ‘manifestations’. ONIX (the language of book data) calls them ‘Products’ and mostly leaves the concept of ‘Works’ to the under-adopted ISTC scheme. Works, in turn, can be called ‘works’, but also ‘titles’, ‘product lines’, and ‘ISTCs’. These options are either ambiguous (“what’s the title’s title?”) or arcane.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All this is enough to conclude, at least, that publishing hasn’t agreed on what the things are called that we produce. I suppose we’ve only had since the fifteenth century. For us, though, we’ve decided to call the body of the writing a ‘work’, and the things that you sell the ‘products’. And so those are the terms that you’ll see on the menus and throughout the application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As well as this, Bibliocloud can be used to store information about maps, spinners, posters, apps, software, audio files and other content-related products. So 'products' seems like a good choice to keep your options open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click on Main menu > Publishing > Works and you’ll be taken to a listing of all your works. There’s one line per work on this page, as opposed to one line per product.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Advanced search</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Use the Advanced search button to reveal a number of search fields that you can use to refine the list of works that you see. (You can click on the button again to hide the fields.) You’ll notice that the ‘To pub date’ field has a date in it which is one year from now: change it if you want to widen your search. A green ‘Search’ button appears at the top of the page, too, when you’ve got these fields revealed. Click it when you've refined your search options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use the top part of the Advanced search area to positively search for information: enter search terms that you want Bibliocloud to include. Conversely, at the bottom of the search form, you can enter search terms that you want Bibliocloud to exclude from the results. You can mix and match: for example, you could select a particular publisher from the top of the search form (Publisher name Is ‘Penguin’), but exclude hardbacks from the search (Edition Is Not ‘Hardback’).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use the section at the bottom of the search area to refine your search based on whether data is present or not – for instance, to find all products where there isn’t an approved cover.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to clear the search form and start again, click on ‘Reset’ at the bottom of the advanced search area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most handy fields on this search form is the Paste ISBN list, which you’ll find at the top right of the form. You can paste an unlimited number of ISBN13s in to that box, separated by a comma, and Bibliocloud will find the works that those ISBNs belong to. This is the sort of thing you should paste into that field:</p>\r\n<code>\r\n9781844830824  ,\r\n9783822832172  ,\r\n9781842931172\r\n</code>\r\nor\r\n\r\n<code>9781844830824,9783822832172,9781842931172</code>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the time you’ll be copying and pasting from an Excel spreadsheet. An easy way to get the commas in is to insert a column to the right of your ISBN13 column. Put a comma in the first cell and copy down to the bottom. Then copy the ISBN13 and the comma columns together. You can paste it into a text editor such as Notepad or TextEdit to see if it looks like the example above. You can paste hundreds of these comma-separated ISBNs into the search field to get the exact list that you want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your search brings back more than 100 works, Bibliocloud will paginate the results, so that the page doesn’t take an eternity to load. You’ll be able to click through the pages either by the page number or by clicking on Prev, Next, First and Last.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Switch to products view</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>If you click this button, you’ll switch to a more detailed view of the same data – where there is one line per product, as opposed to one line per works.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Downloads</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>This button provides a CSV download of the search results. You can get much more detailed exports on the Product search page.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Performance</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Clicking on the Performance button takes you to a graph which shows the actual sales for all the works in your search results. (If you’ve found a lot of works, this can take a while to create.)</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Links</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Clicking on the links in the list of search results takes you to the thing that you’re clicking on. So if you click on a work in the Title column, you’ll go to the edit page for that work. If you click on one of the product descriptions, you’ll go to that product’s edit page. There is a delete button, too. You won’t be able to delete a work if its products already have sales recorded against them, though.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That pretty much covers how to search by works. Now let’s see how to search by product. In Bibliocloud, click on Main menu > Publishing > Products > All, and read the next article in this guide.</>\r\n"], [44, "Navigation", "<p>Bibliocloud runs as a website in your browser, just like facebook.com, twitter.com and guardian.co.uk. You navigate around it by clicking on various links, buttons, headers and tabs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, when you do so, the current page will be closed and the new one opened. If you have made data changes on a page and you navigate to a new page without saving the changes, a popup will appear asking you to confirm that you want to abandon the changes, or whether you’d prefer to stay on the same page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is often the case that you want to go to another page, make a change, and return to your current page. In that case, you can right-click on the link to the other page and select the option to open the link in a new tab or window.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you have finished with the new tab or window, and saved any changes, you can close it and return to your previous Bibliocloud tab. The page will have to be refreshed in order to reflect any saved changes made in the other window.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class = \"bs-callout bs-callout-success\"><h4>What's that orange line?</h4>\r\n<p>Bibliocloud uses something called “turbolinks”. When you click a link in Bibliocloud, only the new bits of code that the page needs will be loaded. It means that the new page loads faster, because it doesn’t have to wait for all the headers, stylesheets and javascript files to load. When you click on a link, you’ll usually see a thin orange progress bar underneath the top navigation bar letting you know how the page load is going.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If, however, you click a button or do something which sends data to the server and back, you’ll see the usual browser spinner, because the whole page has to load again.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h4> The main menu </h4>\r\n<p>Over on the left of every page you’ll find the Main menu. This is a left-aligned menu with a white background and the Bibliocloud logo at the top, which links to the home page. It serves two functions. First, it allows you to get to places. Second, it shows you where you are when you’ve got there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The links are arranged in a hierarchy. So, for instance, you can click on Publishing > Product search > By pub date > 2017 > Jan to reveal all the products published in Jan 2017. Once you’re looking at those products, the menu will stay expanded so you can see your context at a glance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you’re on a page which doesn’t require you to see the Main menu, it’ll tuck itself away. You can reveal it in one of two ways. Firstly, you can hover your mouse over the left hand side of the browser and it’ll slide out. Alternatively, you can click on the three-lines icon, which is top-left of every screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4> Local menus</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking at a particular product record is one of those times when the Main menu gets hidden. In its place, however, you’ll get a local menu. This menu changes depending on the sort of page you’re on. So if you’re looking at a title page, you’ll get the Title local menu. If you’re looking at a royalty statement, you’ll get the royalties local menu. The local menus that you’ll come across are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Title</li>\r\n<li>Address book</li>\r\n<li>Royalties</li>\r\n<li>Collections</li>\r\n<li>Schedules</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4> Conventions</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>There are some design conventions which apply throughout Bibliocloud, for consistency and ease of navigation. First up, colours. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>We use orange to highlight something. Words and shapes in orange are intended to draw your eye, often to a summary of the page that you’re on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blue indicates something you can click on. If you click on a blue coloured link, you can expect to be taken to another part of the system – just like a link on any website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you click on a button, then it will do something – it will trigger some sort of action, or process. You’ll find buttons when you want to run royalties, or add a new set of fields in the address book, or reveal the advanced search options on the Product listing page. With buttons, you click, you usually remain on the same page, and something happens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Green means OK, yes, save, and everything’s fine. Red means there’s danger, or a problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class = \"bs-callout bs-callout-success\">\r\n<h4><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_Design\">Material Design</a></h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Material design is an aesthetic philosophy created by Google. It uses grid-based layouts, responsive animations and transitions, padding, and depth effects such as lighting and shadows. Designer Matías Duarte explained that “unlike real paper, our digital material can expand and reform intelligently. Material has physical surfaces and edges. Seams and shadows provide meaning about what you can touch.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Material Design provides a consistent experience across all platforms and applications including Gmail, YouTube, Google Drive, Google Docs, Sheets and Slides, Google Maps, Inbox, all of the Google Play-branded applications, and to a smaller extent the Chrome browser and Google Keep. The desktop web interfaces of Google Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides and Inbox have incorporated it as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have adopted Material Design:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>to take advantage of some beautifully well-thought-through, mature design principles</li>\r\n<li>to aid usability and interaction with the app, and lend it a look and feel that is more familiar to you from </li>other websites and apps you might use</li>\r\n<li>to make Bibliocloud much more usable on smaller devices</li>\r\n</ul></div>\r\n\r\n<h4>Types of pages</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>We keep the look-and-feel and the layout of pages consistent throughout Bibliocloud so that it’s easier to use. Here are the types of pages that you’ll come across as you use the system.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<h5>List search pages</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>List search pages provide a summary of records. The Product search page, for instance, contains one line per product, based on the search criteria you’ve entered. List pages are a way to see the woods from the trees. Clicking on the name of the record takes you to the individual page for that record, where you can see much more detail about the record and edit it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Edit pages</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Bibliocloud has a lot of form fields. A lot. After all, it’s a system to store data, and that data has to be inputted somehow. (Bibliocloud also has a lot of ways to help you automatically import data in bulk). Edit pages are where you enter and save data via form fields.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where there is a drop down field on an edit page, you can type any bit of the name of the option you’re looking for, and the list will whittle itself down to just the options that contain those letters. So if you were looking at the BIC code list, and you typed ‘bro’, the list would go from 2668 options to just 3: ‘Internet browsers’, ‘Living and working abroad’ and ‘Embroidery crafts’.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Display pages</h5>\r\n\r\nSometimes, there’s a display page as well as an edit page. You can see an overview of a title (Main menu > Publishing > Product search > [click on a product] > Overview), or you can see a preview of a contract before you produce its PDF (Main menu > Publishing > Agreements > Contracts > Search > [click on a contract]). Usually you can’t edit information on a display page, but there’ll be links to take you to related areas.</p>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>Icons</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>We have tried to keep the use of icons to a minimum because <a href=\"http://uxmyths.com/post/715009009/myth-icons-enhance-usability\">multiple user interface studies</a> show that words are so much clearer. We have used some icons, sparingly, to illuminate certain frequently-encountered options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First of all, we’ll look at the icons you’ll find at the top of every page, on the header bar.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n\r\n<h5>Three lines <i class=\"fa fa-reorder\"></i></h5>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the Main menu toggle button, and it’s found at the top-left of every screen. Click on it and the Main menu will slide out. Click on it again to tuck the Main menu away until you need it. You can also slide the Main menu out by hovering your mouse over to the left of your browser window. Some people call that icon a “hamburger”</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Home (green Bibliocloud logo)</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>This icon is at the top of the Main menu, and it takes you to your home page, which is a dashboard-like overview of your recent activity, and some useful links to tasks and projects.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class =\"bs-callout bs-callout-success\">\r\n<h4>Set your own homepage</h4>\r\n<p>To bookmark a page, go to the page in question and click on the Lightning bolt icon on the black header bar. Click ‘Bookmark this page’ and give your bookmark a name. Click ‘Save’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you have some bookmarks, you can choose one to be your personal home page. Click on your user account icon, which is the third icon from the right: a little head and shoulders on the right-hand side at the top of every page. Find the bookmark section and click ‘Set as homepage’ against the relevant bookmark. Now when you click on the Home icon, you’ll go to your bookmarked homepage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to revert to the system default, you can click ‘Delete’ next to the bookmark on your user account.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h5>Envelope <i class=\"fa fa-envelope\"></i></h5>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the first icon you’ll see in the clump of icons at the top right of every page (except for very narrow browser windows, where it goes to the bottom of the Main menu to save space). Click on it and an email will open in your preferred email client, with a link to the current page. This means if you’re on a page and you want to draw a colleague’s attention to it, you can send them a quick email with the link.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Lightning bolt <i class=\"fa fa-flash\"></i></h5>\r\n<p>\r\nThis is the second icon you’ll see in the clump of icons at the top right of every page (except for very narrow browser windows, where it disappears to save space). Click on it to reveal the Quick Jump menu. You can quickly add a product review, or jump to add a new title or contact. You can also use this area to bookmark pages, and then jump to your bookmarked pages.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Bell<i class=\"fa fa-bell\"></i></h5>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the background task monitor. Background tasks are processes that take a fairly long time, such as creating all the data for a new title and its products, or generating royalty statements. By ‘a long time’, we mean more than a couple of seconds – which feels like an eternity when you’re using a website. Bibliocloud runs these tasks in the background, so your browser doesn’t time out and so you can continue to use the system. When there are no tasks running, the bell is crossed out. If it’s not crossed out, it’ll also have a number in an blue circle, which is the total number of tasks that are running in the background.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Box with a tick <i class=\"fa fa-check-square-o\"></i></h5>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the To Do management area. If it has a number in an blue circle, this is the number of tasks you currently have to do. If there is no number, there are no tasks running. You can click on the box to set some going.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Head and shoulders <i class=\"fa fa-user\"></i></h5>\r\n<p>This is the link to your user account.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Question mark <i class=\"fa fa-question-circle\"></i></h5>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the link to various forms of help and support. There’s a link to The Bibliocloud Book which you’re currently reading. There are also links for you to send us feedback and questions. At the bottom of the list, there’s a link to Bibliocloud’s information site, http://bibliocloud.com.</p>\r\n<div class =\"bs-callout bs-callout-success\">\r\n\r\n<h5>Send us support tickets!</h5>\r\n<p>We can’t stress enough how important it is to send us support tickets. We love to receive them because they provide us with a timely insight into how things are going, any parts of the system that are causing confusion and how we can help before a niggle turns into a real problem. So please do use the support ticket option as much as you can!</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h5>Exit <i class=\"fa fa-sign-out\"></i></h5>\r\n<p>This is the link to sign you out of the system. Sign out every time your working session comes to an end – usually at the end of the day. No need to sign out over lunch, but try not to leave yourself signed in all the time, or it’ll cost you money you needn’t spend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That takes care of the icons you’ll see at the top of every page. The following icons appear on pages throughout Bibliocloud.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Plus sign <i class=\"fa fa-plus\"></i></h5>\r\n\r\n<p>This means ‘add a new something’ – for example, add a new price.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Downwards pointing arrow <i class=\"fa fa-down-arrow\"></i></h5>\r\n\r\n<p>This means ‘click and more options will be revealed below’.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Expand and collapse sign <i class=\"fa fa-sort\"></i></h5>\r\n\r\n<p>You’ll find the expand and collapse icon on the Advanced Search button, where clicking once will reveal the search fields, and clicking again will hide them. The icon is made up of two caret shapes, one pointing up, one down.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Data management tools</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Where users are required to enter blocks of text, Bibliocloud provides a range of tools to edit it. For example, when a user enters a marketing text, such as the blurb, a biographical note or a review, they are provided with a spellchecker, a grammar checker, a word count, a character count and an HTML WYSIWYG (‘what you see is what you get’) editor.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Spelling, grammar and sentence structure checker</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Bibliocloud comes with an amazingly clever spelling and grammar checker which uses an open source online resource called Ginger. Bibliocloud will provide suggestions, rather than autocorrecting, to avoid irritation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ginger’s mission is to remove language barriers between people by enabling everyone to communicate in native-level English.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its Grammar Checker software technology searches the web and analyzes the content of millions of web pages to create statistical linguistic patterns. These patterns are used to understand the probable meaning of a written sentence. When a user writes a sentence, Grammar Checker’s engine compares the sentence structure and meaning to billions of similar sentences from the web to find similar match, and suggests a correction based on the results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its Sentence Rephraser analyzes your text sentence by sentence to find sentences which can be improved by adding synonyms, superlatives or other missing words. When alternative phrases are identified, Ginger displays the options so that you can find the phrasing that works best for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>HTML WYSIWYG editor</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>There are various buttons that you can use to format your text without having to use HTML tags such as <code>< b ></code> for bold and <code>< i ></code> for italic. However, Bibliocloud will insert those HTML tags for you, behind the scenes, so that your formatting is preserved when you send your data to other companies such as Amazon.</p>\r\n"], [65, "Projects", "<p>Projects are areas where you can group a lot of the other tools that you&rsquo;ll read about in this section. Schedules, products, titles, contacts, notes, files, settings &ndash; this area is a place to store all manner of disparate information that shares a common project.</p>\r\n<p>We use this area to run Bibliocloud implementations, for example. We store the schedule here, and use the milestones tab to check that we&rsquo;re on track and meeting the critical path. We can upload client&rsquo;s sample files here, and make notes on our meetings and progress</p>"], [66, "Collections", "<p>Collections are a way of grouping products. The sort of grouping is up to you: it might be by publication month, or editor, or project stage &ndash; anything which helps you to manage groups of records in a way that will help you out. There are two types of collection: ones that everyone can see, and personal/private collections for your eyes only.</p>\r\n<p>From the <code>Main menu</code>, select <code>Workflow &gt; Collections</code>. You&rsquo;ll see all the public collections, and any of your own private ones. Click <code>Add new</code> and a pop-up will appear for you to give your new collection a name. You can also allocate a parent collection &ndash; so you can have a large collection that is broken down into smaller collection.</p>\r\n<div class =\"bs-callout bs-callout-success\"> </h4>AN EXAMPLE COLLECTION</h4>\r\n<p>Parent: &lsquo;2016 books&rsquo;</p>\r\n<p>Sub-collections: &lsquo;January 2016&rsquo;, &lsquo;February 2016&rsquo; and so on.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>If you want the collection to be private, so only you can see it, tick the box that says &lsquo;Private?&rsquo</p>\r\n<h3>ADD ONE PRODUCT TO A COLLECTION</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>From any page which displays the title navigation bar, select <code>Product Metadata &gt; [name] &gt; Basics &gt; Collections tab</code> and the name of the product you want to add to a collection.</li>\r\n<li>Click Add to collection.</li>\r\n<li>Select the collection from the drop down list, by typing part of the name or scrolling to browse. Hit save.</li>\r\n<li>You&rsquo;ll be returned to the main metadata page for the title, where you can add the title or its products to more collections if you wish.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3>ADD MULTIPLE PRODUCTS TO A COLLECTION</h3>\r\n<p>If you use the Current products page to display a set of titles, you can add all or some of them in one go to a collection.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Get your products: from the <code>Main menu</code>, select <code>Publishing &gt; Titles &gt; Product search</code> and click on <code>Advanced search</code> to whittle down your selection.</li>\r\n<li>There is a checkbox in the far-left column of each line of the listings table. Check the boxes of the products that you would like to be added to your collection. If you want to add all the products on that page to your collection, you can check the box right at the top of the listings, which selects all the checkboxes in one go.</li>\r\n<li>Click on the button at the top of the page labelled &lsquo;Batch actions&rsquo;. A pop-up will appear.</li>\r\n<li>Select &lsquo;Add to a collection&rsquo; from the drop down list. Another field will appear: select your collection from the list.</li>\r\n<li>Click &lsquo;Run&rsquo; at the bottom of the pop-up.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>If a title belongs to a collection it will be show on the title page&rsquo;s navigation bar, under <code>Workflow &gt; Collections</code>.</p>\r\n<h3>REMOVE A RECORD FROM A COLLECTION</h3>\r\n<p>Go to the collected record record itself. If this is a collection of products, go to the product&rsquo;s record. From the local product menu go to <code>Product metadata &gt; Basics &gt; Collections</code>. Click <code>Remove</code> next to the collection you want to remove the product from.</p>\r\n<h3>Edit </h3>\r\n<p>In a collection, click on <code>Edit</code> on the local collection menu. You&rsquo;ll see tabs labelled To-Dos, Schedules, Notes, Catalogue and Sort.</p>\r\n<h4>TO-DOS</h4>\r\n<p>The To-dos functionality allows you to set up simple tasks to be repeated on your collection, whatever it contains. </p>\r\n<h4>SCHEDULES</h4>\r\n<p>You can attach a schedule to a collection, just like you attach a schedule to a product or a title. This is useful if you want to manage a schedule at a wrapped-up level &ndash; a publishing season, say, where all the books need to go to the printer by a certain date. Schedules help you monitor progress in managing a set of inter-dependent tasks, for example the completion of marketing texts, finalisation of pricing, and approval of cover images prior to the production of marketing materials.</p>\r\n<p>Enter a name, select a template and click &lsquo;save&rsquo;. You&rsquo;ll be able to access your schedule from the Schedule tab on the collection, or from the local collections menu under <code>What&rsquo;s in it? &gt; Schedules</code>.</p>\r\n<h4>NOTES</h4>\r\n<p>You can add free-text notes here about the collection, should you want to.</p>\r\n<h4>CATALOGUE</h4>\r\n<p>One of the most useful aspects of a collection is that you can use it to produce a catalogue of the collection&rsquo;s contents. You can produce a catalogue in one of two ways: either a quick straight-to-PDF way, or by generating an XML file which you can import into an InDesign template, which provides greater layout flexibility. The <code>Catalogue</code> tab allows you to configure options for the more in-depth XML-to-InDesign workflow.</p>\r\n<p>Firstly, you can say whether this collection contains backlist or frontlist titles. Bibliocloud will generate a different sort of XML for backlist and for frontlist. The InDesign template for frontlist titles can accommodate half or full pages for each product. The backlist template, though, has four or five products to a page with no description.</p>\r\n<p>Next, you can say which proprietary editions should be described in the metadata of each frontlist catalogue entry. You probably wouldn&rsquo;t want proof copies, airside editions and so on to be included, so you can use the checkboxes to say what you do want.</p>\r\n<h4>SORT</h4>\r\n<p>Again for the catalogue and also for the A3 export of the items in your collection, you can sort records. Click on the <code>Sort</code> tab to see your products. Sorting is only relevant for a collection with child collections, because you first sort the child collections, then the items within that collection.</p>\r\n<p>So for instance the collection might be called &lsquo;Spring 2016&rsquo;, the child collections might be called &lsquo;Jan to Mar&rsquo; and &lsquo;Apr to Jun&rsquo;, and each child collection might contain 15 titles.</p>\r\n<p>You can also say whether a product should be on a full or a half page in the catalogue when you&rsquo;re sorting them.</p>\r\n<h3>WHAT&rsquo;S IN IT?</h3>\r\n<p>Collections can contain Projects, Schedules, Titles and Contacts, and a mixture of them, too. It can have a parent collection, sibling collections and child collections. It can have child to-dos and child schedules. All these relationships can be seen at a glance on the <code>What&rsquo;s in it?</code> part of the local collections menu.</p>\r\n<h3>Tools</h3>\r\n<h4>Validations</h4>\r\n<p>If the collection contains products, this page will allow you to run validations for all the products in the collection.</p>\r\n<h3>EXPORTS</h3>\r\n<p>This is where you can output the contents of your collection in a number of ways.</p>\r\n<p>Along with the <code>Product search</code> page, a print-out of a collection is the report most likely to replace that A3 Excel printout with an impossibly small font size that you might have relied on in your pre-Bibliocloud days. So there is an A3 PDF download option if you still like to see your data in that sort of format. Remember the golden rule, though: don&rsquo;t edit data outside of Bibliocloud!</p>\r\n"], [67, "Schedules", "<p>Planning and monitoring the execution of a long term plan, such as the publication of a book, can be a challenge even in a small company. Keeping dates in a diary or online calendar can help, but better results can generally be achieved by viewing the publishing process as a formal project that follows one of a number of standard plans.</p>\r\n<p>Bibliocloud helps this process by providing a scheduling capability that includes the ability to define reusable schedule templates for different kinds of project. For example, publishing a trade paperback without illustrations, and with an associated e-book, might be a fairly simple plan. Publication of a colour illustrated co-edition with three partners, and shipping from the Far East to multiple European destinations, could be said to be a shade more complex.</p>\r\n<p>Schedules in Bibliocloud go beyond the planning of publications. They can also be associated with a rights deal, a work, a contract, a printing, or a contact (for contract negotiations, for example, or party planning, perhaps).</p>\r\n<p>You can also make available a calendar of the schedules tasks so that calendaring systems outside of Bibliocloud can list the tasks and their start and end dates. The tasks listed as calendar events will only be those at the lowest level of detail.</p>\r\n<h3>COMPONENTS OF A SCHEDULE</h3>\r\n<p>The main features of a schedule are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Tasks</li>\r\n<li>Intertask dependencies</li>\r\n<li>Task durations</li>\r\n<li>Task responsibilities</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Tasks</strong></p>\r\n<p>Each task should be a well-defined unit of work for which the responsibility is traceable to a single person. Where a set of tasks are all part of achieving a particular stage in a project (for example &lsquo;Translate to French&rsquo;, &lsquo;Translate to Hungarian&rsquo;, &lsquo;Translate to Spanish&rsquo; ) they can be grouped together under a parent task (&lsquo;Prepare foreign language editions&rsquo;). The duration of the parent task then becomes dependent on the durations of the subtasks. The subtasks might all start at the same time, or run one after another, or a combination of the two.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Dependencies</strong></p>\r\n<p>Dependencies are the rules by which tasks are linked. For example, &lsquo;Task C cannot start until Tasks A and B have both finished&rsquo; (other kinds of dependency are also possible in general, such as &lsquo;Task A cannot end until Task B has ended&rsquo;, but these are not implemented in Bibliocloud).</p>\r\n<p>As an example, consider a refit of a kitchen. Tasks might be identified such as:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Remove old kitchen</li>\r\n<li>Tile walls</li>\r\n<li>Order oven</li>\r\n<li>Order sink</li>\r\n<li>Order cabinet</li>\r\n<li>Install sink</li>\r\n<li>Install oven</li>\r\n<li>Install cabinets</li>\r\n<li>Rewire sockets</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>It is common sense that one would not try to install the oven before the cabinets had been fitted. In fact there are a series of dependencies implied by this list, which might be represented as &lsquo;1 -&gt; 9&rsquo; (&lsquo;Remove old kitchen has to be complete before rewiring the sockets can begin&rsquo;), &lsquo;2 -&gt; 8&rsquo;, &lsquo;8 -&gt; 6&rsquo;, &lsquo;8 -&gt; 7&rsquo;, &lsquo;9 -&gt; 2&rsquo; etc.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Duration</strong></p>\r\n<p>This is how long the task is expected to take, in days.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p>\r\n<p>You can add multiple responsibilities to each task.</p>\r\n<h3>SEARCH SCHEDULES</h3>\r\n<p>Schedules can be associated with products, contracts, contacts, production runs, or collections. To create a new schedule for one of these items, go to the relevant item and click on the &ldquo;schedules&rdquo; section. This search page displays all schedules which are not templates. You can also export missed milestones and export all to Excel using the links in the header. The Schedules index page has a number of features including the incorporation of issues, and the incorporation of Key Dates. Key Dates are defined on a schedule template as the ones which you really want to keep a close eye on, such as &ldquo;MS delivery&rdquo;, &ldquo;Handover to production&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Pub date&rdquo;. They appear on the schedule index page along with an indication of status and how the date is performing relative to its budgeted &ldquo;benchmark&rdquo; date. Set Key Dates when you&rsquo;re defining your schedule templates and they&rsquo;ll be inherited by schedules which are built from templates.</p>\r\n<p>This page also contains custom reports, advanced search, the abiity to group by various parameters, a PDF download option, and the option to save searches.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>SEARCH TASKS</h3>\r\n<p>Every schedule is made up of a series of dependent tasks. You can see each schedule&rsquo;s tasks on the schedule page, but this search page is good for an overview across multiple projects. You can use the Advanced Search area to refine your search using the same sorts of search terms you&rsquo;d use on the product search page, as well as task users, schedule names and task names. You can also configure custom reports to download the data to excel in any way you like.</p>\r\n<h3>ADD NEW</h3>\r\n<p>This option provides a new form, which you can use to create a new schedule template. To create a schedule that&rsquo;s associated with products, contracts, contacts, production runs, or collections, go to the relevant item and click on the &lsquo;schedules&rsquo; section.</p>\r\n<h3>TEMPLATES</h3>\r\n<p>This search page displays all schedules which are templates.</p>\r\n<p>* * *</p>\r\n<p>The remaining options on the <code>Main menu</code> link straight through to the schedules themselves.</p>\r\n<h3>SCHEDULE DISPLAY</h3>\r\n<p>The main method of presenting a schedule in Bibliocloud is through a Gantt chart.</p>\r\n<div class=\"bs-callout bs-callout-info\"><h4>GANTT CHARTS</h4>\r\n<p class=\"noindent\">Gantt charts are a form of horizontal bar chart in which each task is represented by a bar. The position and length of the bar represent the duration and start and end times of the task. They will be familiar to users of Microsoft Project, and are integrated into Bibliocloud as a core feature of the scheduling function.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>When you click through to view a schedule, you&rsquo;ll land on the <code>tasks</code> option on the local schedule menu. This is a tabular representation of the tasks that belong to a schedule. If the task is late, it will be shaded in pale red.</p>\r\n<p>Click <code>PDF</code> to export the tasks to PDF in tabular format. <code>Related to</code> on the local schedule menu lets you click through to the parent of the schedule, whether that&rsquo;s a product, collection, or other record in Bibliocloud.</p>\r\n<p>Click on <code>Gantt</code> on the local schedule menu to see and edit the same data in Gantt chart format.</p>\r\n<p>The Gantt editor is composed of three main sub parts/editors: the grid editor on the left, the Gantt editor on the right, and the detailed task editor in the popup. The popup editor is used also for resources and assignments.</p>\r\n<p>Features:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>in-place editing</li>\r\n<li>drag &amp; drop</li>\r\n<li>zooming</li>\r\n<li>do/undo</li>\r\n<li>multiple dependencies</li>\r\n<li>full editing</li>\r\n<li>dates shortcuts</li>\r\n<li>multiple browser</li>\r\n<li>resources editing</li>\r\n<li>multiple assignment</li>\r\n<li>milestones</li>\r\n<li>export data in JSON format</li>\r\n<li>resize &amp; scroll</li>\r\n<li>tasks status</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>How to use:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Hover over the icons at the top of the page to see what they do.</li>\r\n<li>Double click on a bar on the display to add more information about the task, and to assign people and roles.</li>\r\n<li>Click on the coloured square on the left to change the status of tasks.</li>\r\n<li>You can collapse the tasks in a hierarchy by clicking on the plus and minus signs.</li>\r\n<li>The teal vertical line indicates today&rsquo;s date</li>\r\n<li>Parent tasks have a black line running along their top</li>\r\n<li>To move the whole schedule in time, click and hold the very top-most bar, and drag. All the child tasks will move with it, subject to any milestones you&rsquo;ve set.</li>\r\n<li>To change the duration of a task, either hover over the task bar until the cursor shows a left-and-right arrow, click and drag, or type the revised duration into the grid on the left hand side of the screen. You can move the grey vertical divider bar to see the grid.</li>\r\n<li>To change the dependencies, either hover over the task bar until a small circle shows, then click and drag to the dependent task, or type the row numbers of the dependencies into the grid on the left hand side of the screen. You can move the grey vertical divider bar to see the grid. You can have multiple dependencies: separate them with a comma if you&rsquo;re typing in the row numbers.</li>\r\n<li>Duration is always in working days. If there are holidays on the calendar the end date will take them into account.</li>\r\n<li>If there are milestones set, then the task&rsquo;s start/end dates can&rsquo;t move accidentally. You can change dates directly on the task, but not by acting on children or predecessors.</li>\r\n<li>Multiple dependencies are supported. Only the finish-to-start dependency type is supported (other types can be workarounded by introducing intermediary brother tasks or children). It is possible to specify a &lsquo;lag&rsquo; in days by using a &lsquo;:&rsquo;. E.g.: 7:3,8 means that the task will start 3 days after task 7 is completed and task 8 is completed.</li>\r\n<li>Allowed statuses are: ACTIVE, DONE, FAILED, SUSPENDED, UNDEFINED. Task statuses allow to use your project like a sort of workflow: e.g.: if &lsquo;task b&rsquo; depends on &lsquo;task a&rsquo;, &lsquo;task b&rsquo; will remain in &lsquo;SUSPENDED&rsquo; until &lsquo;task a&rsquo; will pass from &lsquo;ACTIVE&rsquo; to &lsquo;DONE&rsquo;. See more below.</li>\r\n<li>Progress is a number that specifies progress: 0% = none, 50% = half way and so on. In some cases, 123% can be a meaningful value for progress, so there are no constraints.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Try to close some tasks (change status to &lsquo;completed&rsquo;); you will see how dependent tasks/children will change their status according to the following rules:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>any status -&gt; DONE: may activate dependent tasks, both suspended and undefined. All descendant will be set to done.</li>\r\n<li>FAILED -&gt; DONE: do nothing if not forced by hand.</li>\r\n<li>UNDEFINED -&gt; ACTIVE: all children become active, if they have no dependencies.</li>\r\n<li>SUSPENDED -&gt; ACTIVE: sets to active all children and their descendants that have no inhibiting dependencies.</li>\r\n<li>DONE -&gt; ACTIVE: all those that have dependencies get set to suspended.</li>\r\n<li>FAILED -&gt; ACTIVE: nothing happens: child statuses must be reset by hand.</li>\r\n<li>any status-&gt; SUSPENDED: all active children and their active descendants become suspended, when not failed or forced</li>\r\n<li>any status-&gt; UNDEFINED: all active children and their active descendants become suspended, when not failed or forced.</li>\r\n<li>any status-&gt; FAILED: children and dependents are set to failed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Make sure you save little and often on this page.</strong> To return to the previous page, click &lsquo;Exit Gantt&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p>Read more about Gantt charts on Wikipedia <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gantt_chart\" target=\"_blank\">[link]</a>.

Once you&rsquo;ve flagged the title appropriately, you can tick it off the to-do list. Click on the task manager on the top navigation bar and select the appropriate status from the drop down list &ndash; &lsquo;Completed&rsquo; will probably be best.

The beauty of it is that these jottings form the early kernel of the work, which, if acquired, will bloom and grow as you add data to the system.

Bibliocloud can keep track of all these tasks and help you to stay organised and on time. For print books, one milestone is often to get the print order to the printer. Bibliocloud can manage this for you too, using the specs in the system. It’s another example of storing data once, using it everywhere: a principle which will save you time & money.</p>\r\n<p>There is a range of tools to choose from in Bibliocloud to manage the many and varied aspects of a publishing programme, and their selection depends on your company culture as well as the task at hand. You might prefer to keep the rough stage that a product is at in a pipeline, which requires just a few keystrokes to set up and maintain. Alternatively you might want to be more rigid and use the more formal Gantt-chart schedules, coupled with templates so you follow the same process for each product. The workflow workshop sheds a lot of light on which workflow tools to select. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read about the tools that Bibliocloud provides to manage workflow in the Workflow section.</p>\r\n"], [5, "Working as a team", "<p>When you use email, or pen and paper, to keep track of team projects and\r\n    data, things are bound to go wrong. Here are some ways to get Bibliocloud\r\n    to help you work as a more effective team.</p>\r\n    <h4>Using schedules</h4>\r\n    <p>Planning and monitoring the execution of a long term plan, such as the\r\n    publication of a book, can be a challenge even in a small company. Keeping\r\n    dates in a diary or online calendar can help, but better results can\r\n    generally be achieved by viewing the publishing process as a formal project\r\n    that follows one of a number of standard plans.</p>\r\n    <p>Bibliocloud helps this process by providing a scheduling capability that\r\n    includes the ability to define reusable schedule templates for different\r\n    kinds of project. For example, publishing a trade paperback without\r\n    illustrations, and with an associated e-book, might be a fairly simple\r\n    plan. Publication of a colour illustrated co-edition with three partners,\r\n    and shipping from the Far East to multiple European destinations, could be\r\n    said to be a shade more complex.</p>\r\n    <p>Schedules in Bibliocloud go beyond the planning of publications. They\r\n    can also be associated with a rights deal, a work, a contract, a printing,\r\n    or a contact (for contract negotiations, for example, or party planning,\r\n    perhaps).</p>\r\n    <p>Using schedules helps every member of the team know what's going on,\r\n    whenever they need to know the status of a project.</p>\r\n    <h4>Issue management</h4>\r\n    <p>The ‘exclamation mark in a circle’ icon on any title's page is your\r\n    shortcut to logging an issue.

Bibliocloud integrates with <a href=\r\n    \"https://slack.com\">Slack.com</a> which is a fantastic way to reduce email\r\n    and keep a team informed about key changes. You can also set the system to\r\n    send emails – but do be aware of ‘system email blindness syndrome’ where\r\n    system-generated emails get ignored because of their frequency and\r\n    impersonal nature.

If\r\n    there are no people, or the relevant person is missing from the dropdown,\r\n    then you’ll need to add the correct role to their profile. Go to the users\r\n    area: <code>Main menu &gt; Settings &gt; Users</code> and click on the correct user.\r\n    You’ll be taken to their profile if you have the appropriate permissions.\r\n    Find the area which contains roles, and select (in our case) Art Director.\r\n    Click <code>save</code> and when you return to the title, you’ll be able to select the\r\n    user from the drop down list next to Art Director.</p>\r\n    <p>To avoid doing this manually for each title, you can use role sets to\r\n    set up the right sorts of roles more quickly.

This page is intended to be used at proposal stage and throughout the manuscript development and production stages, drawing a summary of editorial, production, finance and workflow information onto one page. It contains the sorts of information that is useful at various stages e.g. proposal for acquisition, and handover to production:</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>At proposal</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Which commissioning editor is proposing the project and why they think it’ll work (these thoughts captured in “in-house proposal texts”).</li>\r\n<li>The financial nature of the deal: advances, royalty rates, and additional funds such as Kickstarters and grants.</li>\r\n<li>The illustrations to be included</li>\r\n<li>The author’s bio</li>\r\n<li>Which products we’re planning to publish e.g. slipcase, ebook and paperback, or just hardback.</li>\r\n<li>Subject categorisations</li>\r\n<li>Planned production runs and the spec of the products: paper, binding, embellishments, finishes and additional parts.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h5>At handover from editorial to production</h5>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Production runs and the spec of the products are further refined at this stage</li>\r\n<li>Issues logged about the work, such as author problems, financing problems or any other issues.</li>\r\n<li>MS delivery, including indexes, images, forewords etc, and whether they’re on time</li>\r\n<li>Briefings, both internal and external e.g. from editorial to production, from production to a third party typesetter, etc. </li>\r\n<li>Gratis copies to be sent out</li>\r\n<li>Schedules</li>\r\n<li>As a rough guide on this page, data which will likely be included in the ONIX feed is tagged with a globe icon. We do recommend actually looking at the ONIX specifications to get a better sense of what sort of book data goes out in an ONIX feed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The product overview pages contain only product-level information, and act as a handy snapshot to see the core metadata, marketing texts and cover image. It’s intended to be a rough approximation of an Advance Information sheet, although, since Bibliocloud has over twenty AI templates, each one varies slightly in which data is included. One thing to note on this page is that there is a barcode, generated from the ISBN13, and at 1200dpi it is suitable for placing into InDesign print files.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Local title menu > Work metadata > Basics</h4>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This page contains data which tends to apply to all the products of this title. You can see where you are because the local Title menu has Work Metadata > Basics highlighted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, this page is where you can edit the sort of data that tends to apply to all the products of a title. Have a think for a moment about what sort of data that might be. I've never known the subject, for example, to be different for the hardback and the paperback of a work. But the ISBN13 would definitely change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s look at each of the tabbed sections on this page in turn: Publication, Contributors, Covers, Marketing, Highlight, Prizes, and Contents. You can click on the tabs at the top of the page, or scroll down through each section. When you scroll down, notice the arrow that appears, bottom right – you can click it to scroll back up to the top of the screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Publication tab</h5>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Title:</b> This section contains the title and the subtitle. You can override this at the product level on its Advanced page, if you want the product to have a different title.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can also add your own in-house reference for the title. (You can add more work identifiers on the Work Metadata > Advanced page, and product identifiers on each product’s Basics page.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Series:</b> If the title belongs to a series, select it from the drop down list and fill in the year of annual or part number for each product as appropriate. If you want to add a new series to the system (which means it will appear in the drop down list), click the field label &lsquo;Series&rsquo;, which is a link that will take you to the Series management area. You can also get there by clicking on the three-line icon to reveal the Main menu, then click on Main menu > Settings > ...for titles > Series > Add new.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Publication:</b> The publisher, imprint, publication city and publication country are mandatory ONIX fields. They appear on this page because they&rsquo;re usually the same for all products of a title, but they can also be overridden at the product level. If you change the work publication date, this value sets the publication date for all products, unless it is specifically overridden for individual products (see the table on the page for the individual product pub dates). Changing the title&rsquo;s pub date will only change the pub date of products with the same initial pub date value. Removing the title&rsquo;s pub date will have no effect on the products.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class =\"bs-callout bs-callout-info\"><h4>Which fields are required? which fields are optional?</h4><p> We try hard to make using Bibliocloud as pleasurable as possible. And so we try to avoid situations where Bibliocloud won&rsquo;t let you save some information and get on with your day because you don&rsquo;t know the price, or the ISBN, or something. There are, however, some fields which you absolutely have to fill in before the system will let you save a record. For a product, these are the title, the publisher, and an ISBN13 (even if it&rsquo;s &lsquo;placeholder&rsquo;).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to sending an ONIX message or including products in Bibliocloud&rsquo;s Product API, however, Bibliocloud is a lot more strict. You have to have achieved the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li> The ONIX validations must be passing </li>\r\n<li> The product&rsquo;s contract must be signed &ndash; or, at the very least, there needs to be a signed date entered into the contract&rsquo;s record, even if it&rsquo;s set to a date in the future. </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Bibliocloud is strict about the quality of data leaving the system because we all know how awful it is to try to remove incorrect data from the public domain. Prevention is better than cure (or at least, more cost-effective, more time-saving and less likely to cause anguish).</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<h5>Contributors tab</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Contributors are the people or organisations who – you guessed it – contributed to the title, such as the author, editor or illustrator.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bibliocloud has a separate record for each contributor, in the Address Book. To view or edit these records, click on the name of the contributor on a title’s local Title menu (Product Metadata > ... > Jump to...> contributors > [contributor name]), or on the contributor’s name itself when you’re on the title Basics page (Work Metadata > Basics > Contributors tab). You can also find contributors by going straight to Main menu > Address Book > Search.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Work Metadata > Basics > Contributors tab page has a little table area which provides a summary of which contributors have which roles and are associated with which products. If you hover over the question mark next to the contributor’s name, you’ll see the whole of the contributor’s bio, which you can edit by clicking on the contributor’s name and amending their ‘About’ details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the contributor is listed in the Address book (Main menu > Address book) you can set up relationships between him, her or it (if it’s an organisation) and your titles. From the Work Metadata > Basics > Contributors tab page of a title, you can associate a contributor with the title by clicking the Add contributor link and filling in the form, which is the same form as on the edit page. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you click the 'Add contributor' link, you get the same form fields appear regardless of whether you’re adding a new contributor, or editing an existing record. The first field is for you to select the contributor itself. Select the contributor from the drop down – it can be a person or an organisation. If the contributor hasn’t yet been added to Bibliocloud, follow the link to the Address Book to add it, then return to the title. There is a little bit of text which says 'Contributor not on this list? Click here to add to the Address Book', or you can use Main menu > Address Book > Add new.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As well as selecting the contributor, you need to choose the contributor’s role, too, which is an ONIX code. The sequence number is also necessary, for the sake of completeness, even if there is only one contributor. If you leave this blank, Bibliocloud will take a guess at what it should be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The region, country and language boxes are useful for recording which places and languages the contributor is associated with. Bibliocloud includes them in the ONIX feed to help with discoverability and to fine-tune the regional relevance of the title. Booksellers love to know that a book is local to them – so these fields are a very useful sales tool. We’re going to add some region and language information to the Marcel Proust entry that’s already been created as part of the new title form. We click on edit and add France in the ‘associated with countries’ field, and French in the ‘associated with language’ field.\r\n\r\nFinally, tick the products of this title that the contributor should be associated with. Bibliocloud defaults to ticking them all, so it’s more a case of unticking any products you don’t want to be associated. This might happen if you have an audiobook narrator who, naturally, you want to be associated with the audiobook, but not with the hardback or paperback. You can tick the boxes either on the form itself, or on the Work Metadata > Basics page. Remember to click ‘save’. If you’ve missed out any vital data such as the role, you’ll be asked by Bibliocloud to try again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can download contributor information from this section in a few ways. The 'Download contact details' button produces an Excel spreadsheet download of all the contributors on the title. The Email contributors button creates a new email in your usual email client (Outlook, or Gmail, or similar) and adds all the contributors to the &ldquo;to&rdquo; line, with the title of the product going in the &ldquo;subject&rdquo; line. The Email contributors (bcc) button does a similar thing but puts all the contributors on the &ldquo;bcc&rdquo; line. </p>\r\n\r\n<div class =\"bs-callout bs-callout-info\"><h4>But the paperback doesn't have an illustrator!</h4> Bibliocloud aims to make you do as little data entry as possible. So if there&rsquo;s data that threatens to repeat itself, we make sure you don&rsquo;t have to enter it twice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take contributors. It&rsquo;s often the case, naturally, that the hardback and the paperback of a title would have the same author. But you wouldn&rsquo;t want to have to enter the author&rsquo;s name twice, once for each product. So the system asks you to enter the author&rsquo;s details once only, on the Work Metadata > Basics > Contributor tab.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what happens if there was an illustrated edition of the title? It would have a named illustrator who would need to be credited, but only for that edition. It would be daft if the illustrator&rsquo;s name appeared on the hardback and the paperback&rsquo;s records, if neither product has a single picture in them. In that case, enter the illustrator&rsquo;s details on the title on Work Metadata > Basics > Contributor tab, but untick the boxes next to the hardback and the paperback. Leave the box ticked for the illustrated edition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s how products can optionally inherit the data from their parent title.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<h5>Covers tab</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Covers are another example where products can optionally inherit from their parent. The Work Metadata > Basics > Covers tab page has a little table area which provides a summary of which covers are associated with which products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can upload a cover file from your file system or from a URL. Click the Add file link and fill in the form. Only upload files up to a size of about 300Kb. If you have a good internet connection speed you&rsquo;ll be able to upload slightly larger files. Anything above that rough size, though, is better uploaded using the Bulk Uploader &ndash; there&rsquo;s a link on the cover pop-up in the text If you get a timeout application error on this page, it&rsquo;s probably because you&rsquo;re trying to upload a large file. Try the Bulk Uploader instead, or you can get there from Main menu > Data management > Data Exchange > Bulk imports > ...of covers. This will automatically match [isbn].jpgs to their product, as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To edit the cover image, click on Edit, in the little table on the Work Metadata > Basics > Covers tab. You can download the original image that you uploaded, and a thumbnail from here. You can also amend the usage information and replace the cover image entirely.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you do want to download the cover image quickly, you can also click on the local Title menu > Data management > Exports > Approved cover, and select the one you want.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h5>Marketing tab</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Marketing texts are vital for discoverability and for providing a rich understanding of the book to your readers, and a clear communication of the book&rsquo;s sellability to your retail and wholesale customers. Everything descriptive about the title, that&rsquo;s intended for public display, goes in here: main description, short description, reviews, selling points.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marketing texts are an example where Bibliocloud allows optional inheritance. You wouldn&rsquo;t want a review of an audio book, in which the reader&rsquo;s mellifluous tones are praised, to appear next to the hardback edition. But neither would you want to have to copy and paste a review into every product record on a title.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have descriptive text which is only for an internal audience &ndash; private reasons for wanting to publish the book, for example &ndash; then you enter them as a private note on the title&rsquo;s proposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can use the quick jump &lsquo;lightning&rsquo; icon on the top header bar to add a new review, or you can use the Add marketing text link at the bottom of the marketing texts table on the marketing tab. Use the local Title menu: Work Metadata > Basics > Marketing tab.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Add new marketing text and Edit marketing text pages are the same. On it, there are two fields to describe what the text is. This is one of the few places where Bibliocloud exposes the fact that there are two versions of ONIX supported by Bibliocloud. The &lsquo;marketing text type&rsquo; lists are so different between these two ONIX versions that we allow you to choose from each list. You have to provide the ONIX 3 one, at the very least.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can store the origins of the marketing text, which is helpful if it&rsquo;s a review and you want to track the efficacy of sending out review copies to particular reviewers and publications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can choose a star rating for the marketing text which is helpful when you want to select a few top reviews or texts to share with people, blogs, on press releases or in reprints.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can store both the full text and a pull quote. This is helpful if the review is very long, or patchy, and you want to publish only the best bits. These fields come with a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editor. Click on the pencil icon to see the actual HTML. A word and character count appears for both these fields after you save the record, as well as an amazingly clever spelling and grammar checker which uses an open source online resource called Ginger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you attempt to save the record without including all the required information, Bibliocloud will ask you to try again, highlighting the fields which are required.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Highlight tab</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>For each imprint and title, you can say which titles should be highlighted on your marketing materials. Imagine you have an AI with three thumbnails that say &ldquo;More like this&rdquo;. This area allows you to click through to set these highlighted titles at the overall imprint level &ndash; or you can highlight titles against this particular title.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Prizes tab</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve gone to the bother of entering a prize, and then got somewhere with it, you&rsquo;ll want to shout about it! You can also track which prizes you&rsquo;ve entered using the Copy Tracker.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Contents tab</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Here you can list some of the types of ancillary content in the product, for example illustrations, halftones, graphs and maps. You can say which products have that extra content, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* * *</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve gone through all the tabs of the Basics page now. You can keep coming back to this page to update it as the reviews and the prizes flood in. In the meantime, let&rsquo;s look at the Advanced page. Click on Work Metadata > Advanced.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Advanced</h4>\r\n<p><b>Identifying codes:</b> As the page says, once they&rsquo;re set, these codes uniquely identify the title as a particular work in ONIX. Each one has to be unique within the system, and we strongly discourage changing them for established products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You might end up leaving most of these blank, but it&rsquo;s a good idea to have a unique identifier for your titles as well as your products. Here&rsquo;s some information about the ISTC identifier from Nielsen.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"bs-callout bs-callout-info\"><h4> Why use title identifiers?</h4><p> Here&rsquo;s what Nielsen sensibly say about the business case for using title-level identifiers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Improve Discoverability: </b>Search for a group of books which all contain the same work, even if the books have different titles Filter out unwanted books from a search result where they have the same title but different content Comply With Territorial Rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Automatically identify books intended for overseas markets when there is a territory-specific version available already, so enabling the respect of &lsquo;sole territory rights&rsquo; Improve Collections Management and Sales &amp; Loans Analysis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Collocate books automatically, even when they have different titles Efficiently analyse sales or loans of a work even when it is published under multiple titles or is just a component of a larger publication. Nielsen Book operates one of the first ISTC Registration Agencies, enabling authors, publishers and other authorised representatives to register textual works with an ISTC. They also provide advice and guidance on how to make the most of this important new system. Visit their website or contact them at:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tel: +44 (0)1483 712 215</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fax: +44 (0)1483 712 214</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email: istc.agency@nielsen.com or visit www.istc.nielsenbook.co.uk</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Australia &amp; New Zealand</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tel: +64 (0)9 360 3294</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Email: istc@nielsenbookdata.co.nz</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The other identifiers on the page are again optional but if your workflow has a use for them, enter them here. Hover over the tooltip for more information about them. ISTCs don&rsquo;t belong to the publisher &ndash; they are allocated by a central agency such as Nielsen to the title/work. So we&rsquo;re going to enter A02-2009-00000A8C-B for the ISTC, which is the identifier registered with Nielsen here for Swann&rsquo;s Way.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Work ISBN? but I thought an ISBN belonged to the product?</h4><p> One of the fields you can enter here is a &lsquo;Work ISBN&rsquo;. The work ISBN is naughty. ISBNs belong to products, not titles, right? Titles don&rsquo;t exist &ndash; they are the writing, not a product &ndash; so they can&rsquo;t have a bar code. However, sometimes, other pieces of software need a title  &ndash; or work-level ISBN identifier &ndash; so we let you add it here. But we don&rsquo;t like it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pick your work ISBN by deciding which product is the best general representative of the rest of them. It might be the product with the first pub date, or the hardback. It&rsquo;s up to you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You also have the opportunity to record ISTC information on this page, which will be relevant to you if you&rsquo;re pursuing ISTC compliance with Nielsen and other agencies.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Subjects</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Subjects are another great aid to discoverability. There are a number of different subject classification schemes, and different retailers use different ones according to geography and preference. We suggest you complete as many as possible. To that end, you can set up in-house descriptions of subject categories, which act as a template to save you time. Click on the field label &lsquo;Subjects&rsquo; to access the subjects management area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can also store audience information here. For example if you want to differentiate between Trade and Academic titles, you can store it as an audience code value. This is a searchable field on the Product search page, right at the bottom (More > Audience is&#8230; ).</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>Table of contents</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>You can paste your table of contents into the field on this page and Bibliocloud will process it so that it&rsquo;s suitable for sending in an ONIX message &ndash; i.e. one record for each entry in the table of contents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You do have to get your data into a form that Bibliocloud can understand, before you paste it in. The easiest way to get your Table of Contents data into the correct structure is to paste the text into Excel, add the correct types (part, chapter or paragraph, the level and the component number), and save your Excel file as a CSV. Then open your CSV file in a text editor such as TextEdit or Notepad and copy the results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The columns are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Level e.g. 1, or 1.1, or 1.1.1 Component type e.g. Part, Chapter, Paragraph Component number e.g. 1, 01, 1.1 Title e.g. The Industry.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve covered the Basics information, you can have a look at the Advanced page for your product. Click on Product Metadata > ... > Advanced.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Advanced</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Much of this page gets filled in automatically from the application of templates when you&rsquo;re setting up the new title, and from selecting options on the Basics page such as the Edition.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Format tab</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>This section contains the sort of information that ONIX includes. The hover-y tooltips provide information about each field. The format detail fields change depending on whether the product is an ebook or a print book.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Publication tab</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Much of the sort of information you find in the publication details box is stored at the title level. If it happens to be different for the product, you can override the title-level information here. You can type in the ISBN here if this is a backlist title. Enter it without dashes or spaces (though these will be stripped out if you forget.) You can also alter the parent title, although this is a fairly dangerous thing to do and so the operation is in the &lsquo;danger zone&rsquo;. Contact us if you feel you need to change the parent work, via the support ticketing system (click on the question mark icon on the top right of any page of Bibliocloud).</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>AI tab</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Bibliocloud will create an AI from the data that you enter about your product. Sometimes, however, you&rsquo;ll want to override some data just for presentation purposes, without changing what goes out to Nielsen and others. You can do that here.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Identifiers tab</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>If your product has more than one title you can add it here, with the sort of title that it is. You can add any number of product codes in addition to the ISBN13.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Measurements tab</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Add extents and measurements here.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Sales tab</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>The sales rights here show the detail behind the sales rights selection on the Basic page. You should make a selection from there, first, then review the effects in the Sales Rights section on the Advanced page &ndash; not the other way around, for the sake of a simple life. You can say if this product should not be sold somewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Languages tab</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>You can provide language information here. Use the language role drop down to say what the role of the language is that you&rsquo;ve selected. You can also specify regional language variants &ndash; e.g. if the language is English, and the regional variant is US, then you know the product has US spelling.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Links tab</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>You can use this area to add any website links that are relevant to this product. Adding a link here automatically generates a QR code that you can use outside Bibliocloud.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Related tab</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Related products are derived automatically, based on the properties of the products in the system. Only products with an appropriate publishing status and a valid ISBN are eligible for inclusion in ONIX.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Contents tab</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>Here you can list some of the types of ancillary content in the product, for example illustrations, halftones, graphs and maps. If the data is the same as the title, you can select the option to use that instead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>* * *</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That concludes our review of the Advanced page. The next options on the local Title menu section for each product are for prices, marketing, covers and contributors &ndash; those which apply to the product in question.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Pricing tab</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>Click on 'Add price' to add a new price to a product. The main fields to complete are the currency and the price amount. Bibliocloud will attempt to populate other fields left blank. Here is some detail about how to set the correct tax information.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Product tax types</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>These allow you to specify how a product will be treated for sales or value-added tax purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Product tax types are associated with different tax codes in different tax regimes, and the tax code is used to determine the amount of tax to be applied. By specifying a product tax type you allow the system to determine the correct tax code for each tax regime in which the product is for sale.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Classes of Product Tax Type</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>There are generally three classes of product tax type.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Primary Product Tax Types</b> are the most basic, and are the most general, high-level description of a product type for the purposes of determining sales taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An obvious example is &lsquo;Printed book&rsquo;, which covers a wide range of actual product types in practice but which is often treated differently to other products in many tax regimes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Secondary Product Tax Types </b>are subtypes of the primary product tax types, and they allow you to be more specific about the tax treatment because particular tax regimes may have exemptions from or modification to general rules that have to be respected. For example, a regime might specify a particular tax code for eBooks by default, but that they are taxable at a different rate if they are delivered to the customer on a physical medium &ndash; a memory stick, for example &ndash; instead of the usual electronic delivery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each secondary type will have a parent type, which may itself be a secondary type. In the example above we might have a primary type of &lsquo;Electronic book&rsquo; with subtypes of &lsquo;Electronic book, electronic delivery&rsquo; and &lsquo;Electronic book, physical delivery&rsquo;. The latter might itself have subtypes to describe the type of physical medium, if that were necessary to determine the correct tax treatment, and a hierarchy of increasingly specific secondary types is therefore possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a particular regime does not have specific rules concerning a secondary product tax type then the system will look for rules for the immediate parent of the subtype. Again, if no rules are found for that type then its parent will be used, until an &lsquo;ancestor&rsquo; with a specified tax treatment is found. If no ancestor type has rules associated with it then the tax regime&rsquo;s default tax code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, tax regimes generally tax eBooks in a particular way by default, but might specify that they are taxable at a different rate if they are delivered to the customer on a physical medium &ndash; a memory stick, for example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Composite Product Tax Types: </b>If you sell a product that has multiple components of different types, such as a printed book about the works of a composer with a music CD attached, then the components may be treated differently for tax purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is achieved by using a composite product tax type that contains multiple other types. In the example above, we can define a composite product tax types called &lsquo;Print book and music CD&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that a composite product tax type cannot be part of a hierarchy &ndash; you cannot assign a parent to it, nor can it be a parent of another type.</p>\r\n\r\n"], [87, "Product metadata", "<p>The local Title menu > Product Metadata > ... > Basics page is where you can edit the product-specific data of the title. Hover over the tooltips for guidance on what to add.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Identity tab</h5>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Title:</b> These fields initially get populated from the title. If you want this product to have a different title to the other products, and to its parent title, enter it here. The edition is an important field, here: you should select an option, and Bibliocloud will fill in all the format information on its template.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Identifying codes:</b>The primary identification code for a book-trade product is the ISBN13. You might have asked Bibliocloud to allocate one when you created the title. If you didn’t, and you selected ‘use placeholder’, you can select an ISBN13 from the drop down list. ISBN13s get set up with an imprint, so you can see which ISBN13s should be allocated to which book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If this is a backlist title and you need to type in a specific ISBN13, go to Advanced > Publication.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Publishing status tab</h5>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Dates:</b>The publication date can be locked to avoid any of your colleagues changing it. If you want to unlock it, click on the lock icon. If you were the one who locked it in the first place it’ll unlock and you can change the date. If, however, one of your colleagues last locked the date, Bibliocloud will bring up an email which you’ll need to send to them to ask them to unlock it. </p>\r\n\r\n<div class =\"bs-callout bs-callout-info\">You can set the publication date for all the products of the work back on the Work Metadata > Basics page.</div>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Status:</b>You can set the status of the product here. There’s a convenient helper in Data management > Tools > Set as available > [product]. This does the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Publishing status set to ‘04 Active’</li>\r\n<li>Product Availability set to ‘20 Available’</li>\r\n<li>Availability Status Code set to ‘IP Available’</li>\r\n<li>‘Expected availability date’ set to null.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Default availabilities:</b> These elements refer specifically to the supply availability of the product, rather than its publishing status. In general these data can be related to a particular supplier of the product in a particular market, but for for most cases they can be considered to be global settings.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Collections tab</h5>\r\n<p>The product can be added to any number of collections. Click ‘Add to a collection’ to bring up a dialogue box and select from the drop down list. Click on the collection name to go to its page. Read more about collections in the workflow section of this guide.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h5>Marketing tab</h5>\r\n<p><b>Contributor statement:</b> You can store a biography of your contributors in the Address Book. This means that the info can be used for all the products that the contact has contributed to. But if you need to have a more tailored biography, that&rsquo;s relevant only to this product, you can enter it here. A (very weak) example might be &lsquo;Bob lives in Clacton. His idea for this book came to him whilst he was on holiday in New Zealand.&rsquo;</p>\r\n"], [2, "Bibliocloud replaces...", "<p>Publishers often consider Bibliocloud when they need a way to send ONIX, or to calculate royalties, or another singular purpose.

The plus-point is that they're quick and pretty. The downside is that you can't edit them. If you need the flexibility of editing -- which you do, really, for your proper seasonal catalogue -- read the \"complex catalogue\" section below.</p>\r\n<p>You can use the batch actions functionality on the Product search page to generate a PDF catalogue. You can do the same from a collection.</p>\r\n<p>To generate this quick-and-dirty PDF catalogue, you have to set up a catalogue template. Click on <code>Main menu > Settings > ... for marketing > Catalogues > Add new</code>. Give the template a title, a date, a strap line and a running header. Add contact info and pages info if you want. The best thing to do is to set up a quick template, produce a PDF from a collection and then refine your text once you know how it fits on the page.</p>\r\n<h4>Complex catalogues</h4>\r\n<p>You can use Bibliocloud to export an XML file, which you then import into an InDesign template. To specify which products go into the XML file, create a set of nested collections. To do this, first create a new collection and call it something like \"Spring catalogue\". Once you've done that, add another collection, and make its parent your \"Spring catalogue\" collection. Call this one \"Jan to Mar\" or similar. This means you can create the XML for a catalogue that will have separate sections: the sections containing the products in the separate collections.</p>\r\n<p>In the parent collection, click <code>Edit > Catalogue</code>.The Catalogue tab allows you to configure options for your XML export that you'll import into InDesign.</p>\r\n<p>Firstly, you can say whether this collection contains backlist or frontlist titles. Bibliocloud will generate a different sort of XML for backlist and for frontlist. The InDesign template for frontlist titles can accommodate half or full pages for each product.

If you’re not familiar with advanced InDesign use, contact us and we can run a separate project for you to either train you up or design the relevant InDesign template – or put you in touch with other suppliers who can help. We recommend a book called \"The Designer's Guide to InDesign and XML\" which will teach you all you need to know about using InDesign with XML. This book is a lot more complete, and a lot cheaper (at around $30), than a training course.</p>\r\n<p>If you want an alternative XML export, try the detailed author XML option.</p>\r\n<p>You can also export images to work along with your InDesign template.

The naming convention of the files is Work ID, a long title name or the ISBN, depending on which option you select.

For anything other than trivial flat-rate calculations, you really want a database, because rather than dealing with a single row of data, you want to be able to reference different sources of data at the same time  -- sales, escalators, dates, author details.</p>\r\n<p>You capture royalty rates in the contract part of Bibliocloud. Bibliocloud includes those rates in the PDF contract it generates -- which you print and send to the author or agent for signature.</p>\r\n<p>The same data is used by Bibliocloud when it's time to run royalties and generate royalty statements. So there's a lovely sense of consistency for the author. It helps you to make good on your brand promise of a good authorial experience. Accuracy, timeliness, clarity, consistency: authors appreciate these attributes of your relationship more than anything, and Bibliocloud helps you to deliver them.</p>\r\n<h4>Permissions</h4>\r\n<p>Permissions aren't ideal on email or in spreadsheets because you really need one canonical place to record what permissions you have granted, and been granted. That means you can't really share the spreadsheet easily with colleagues, and you can't associate permissions with the text or image concerned. Bibliocloud allows you to do that. </p>\r\n<h4>Rights</h4>\r\n<p>It pains me more than almost anything else to see a spreadsheet in the Rights department that is so close in detail to Editorial's -- but which is, by necessity, out of synch with it. With one central database, there is only one version of the list of books and the rights you hold as an organisation. Maintaining key metadata properly means the rights department don't need to spend much of their time maintaining data.</p>"], [16, "Your legacy data", "<p>Reading about how great Bibliocloud is throughout this guide is all very well, but you'll likely be thinking 'yes, but I haven't had the luxury of a system to keep my data in order.

You've completed your whistlestop tour of Bibliocloud, and you've learned how it can help you to run your publishing company more effectively.</p>\r\n<p>You've learned that it's not all about computer systems and that you have to get your workflow right first before tackling any sort of project like implementing Bibliocloud.</p>\r\n<p>You've learned how Bibliocloud can support you in some of the usual publishing processes, and the tools to help you manage some of those processes as well as you can.</p>\r\n<p>You've also started to see how to navigate around Bibliocloud and how to get and keep your data in a decent shape.</p>\r\n<p>What's next? The next section is a full help manual, where you can step through the whole of Bibliocloud's functionality in order. We're always around for support calls and that's part of your user license fee, so do use the chance to ask detailed questions of us when you're in the moment. </p>\r\n<p>And do let us know if there are other things you'd like to find in this guide -- it's an ongoing work in progress which expands as Bibliocloud grows.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks for reading and enjoy Bibliocloud!</p>"], [32, "Forecasting", "<p>Bibliocloud offers a proposal and evaluation function to help marshal all of the facts, estimations and outright guesses that are a part of the publishing process.</p>\r\n<p>This is intended to serve a number of functions:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>By providing a single place to store the numbers on which your decision to buy the book was based, they are available to all and to some extent &lsquo;unloseable&rsquo;. You know just where the numbers are, and you can share them easily with colleagues.</li>\r\n<li>By providing a single structure, with suitable variations where appropriate, the data from all proposals are stored, held and presented in a consistent manner, enabling a better assessment of competing proposals.</li>\r\n<li>The structure provides a reminder of all the detail that must be considered in order for a proposal to be comprehensive, with no nasty surprises later when printing or co-edition costs were perhaps found to have been accidentally excluded.</li>\r\n<li>The system provides a permanent store for the data so that at a later stage the estimations and assumptions can be measured for accuracy, and the company can institute a learning process to improve future proposal work.</li>\r\n<li>You know how much money your business will make if your sales and costs come in as you forecast. If you don&rsquo;t forecast your revenues and costs, and check that the former will exceed the latter, you could be driving towards bankruptcy and not even know it.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n"], [34, "Use templates", "<p>There are a number of templates in Bibliocloud to save you time.</p>\r\n<p>Contract templates are found in <code>Settings > for legal </code> and allow you to reuse clauses texts, whilst mixing in data for the contract you're working on. Apply the template to the contract on its editing page. </p>\r\n<p>Schedule templates are useful because they mean you can pull off reports for multiple schedules but make sure they have the same named tasks. It makes it easier to compare data across multiple schedules.</p>\r\n<p>AI and catalogue templates let you define the logos, static text, contact information and layouts of marketing material exports.</p>\r\n<p>Title templates allow you to set the usual sorts of categories for your new title. They also let you set up a new title's contract based on an existing one which can be helpful.</p>\r\n<p>Sales and returns profiles allow you to define the curve of sales and returns over a period of time -- say, 1 or 5 years -- so that you only have to enter a total volume. Bibliocloud will figure out the net receipts based on the channel's usual discount, the product's price and then spread that total according to the curve in the profile.</p>\r\n"], [57, "Prices", "<h4>On creation</h4>\r\n<p>Although product prices can be complex to fully specify, you can add multiple prices with sensible defaults by simply typing in a string of individual prices on the \"Add new title\" form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each price should consist of a currency code, such as ‘GBP’ or ‘AUD’, followed by a number. You can specify multiple prices by separating them with commas The system is fairly forgiving of the format of the number and currency code, allowing you to specify ‘gbp 7’, or ‘USD3.56’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For prices specified in GBP the system will create an ‘RRP exc. tax’ price that includes VAT at the correct rate for print or eBooks, and for all other currencies it will create an ‘RRP exc. tax’ price.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The default price for the product will be the first price specified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Territories for which the price is applicable will be inferred from the currency code, by using a country code equal to the first two characters of the currency. For Euro-denominated prices the system will enter the list of Eurozone countries (currently AD, AT, BE, CY, DE, EE, ES, FI, FR, GR, IE, IT, LU, LV, MC, ME, MT, NL, PT, SI, SK, SM and VA).</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>After creation</h4>\r\n<p>Click on <code>Add price</code> to add a new price to a product on the product's local menu. The main fields to complete are the currency and the price amount. Bibliocloud will attempt to populate other fields left blank. Here is some detail about how to set the correct tax information.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Product tax types</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>These allow you to specify how a product will be treated for sales or value-added tax purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Product tax types are associated with different tax codes in different tax regimes, and the tax code is used to determine the amount of tax to be applied. By specifying a product tax type you allow the system to determine the correct tax code for each tax regime in which the product is for sale.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5>Classes of Product Tax Type</h5>\r\n\r\n<p>There are generally three classes of product tax type.</p>\r\n\r\n<b>1) Primary Product Tax Types</b>\r\n\r\n<p>These are the most basic, and are the most general, high-level description of a product type for the purposes of determining sales taxes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An obvious example is ‘Printed book’, which covers a wide range of actual product types in practice but which is often treated differently to other products in many tax regimes.</p>\r\n\r\n<b>2) Secondary Product Tax Types</b>\r\n\r\n<p>These are subtypes of the primary product tax types, and they allow you to be more specific about the tax treatment because particular tax regimes may have exemptions from or modification to general rules that have to be respected. For example, a regime might specify a particular tax code for eBooks by default, but that they are taxable at a different rate if they are delivered to the customer on a physical medium – a memory stick, for example – instead of the usual electronic delivery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each secondary type will have a parent type, which may itself be a secondary type. In the example above we might have a primary type of ‘Electronic book’ with subtypes of ‘Electronic book, electronic delivery’ and ‘Electronic book, physical delivery’. The latter might itself have subtypes to describe the type of physical medium, if that were necessary to determine the correct tax treatment, and a hierarchy of increasingly specific secondary types is therefore possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a particular regime does not have specific rules concerning a secondary product tax type then the system will look for rules for the immediate parent of the subtype. Again, if no rules are found for that type then its parent will be used, until an ‘ancestor’ with a specified tax treatment is found. If no ancestor type has rules associated with it then the tax regime’s default tax code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, tax regimes generally tax eBooks in a particular way by default, but might specify that they are taxable at a different rate if they are delivered to the customer on a physical medium – a memory stick, for example.</p>\r\n\r\n<b>3) Composite Product Tax Types</b>\r\n\r\n<p>If you sell a product that has multiple components of different types, such as a printed book about the works of a composer with a music CD attached, then the components may be treated differently for tax purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is achieved by using a composite product tax type that contains multiple other types. In the example above, we can define a composite product tax types called ‘Print book and music CD’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that a composite product tax type cannot be part of a hierarchy – you cannot assign a parent to it, nor can it be a parent of another type.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n"], [60, "Royalties", "\r\n<p>Calculation of royalties against sales is a notoriously tricky business, and there appears to be no limit to the human imagination when it comes to what elements might be considered and what clauses included in an agreement on payable royalties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bibliocloud&rsquo;s royalty and statement engine consider the following factors in determining royalties payable:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The quantity and value of sales for each sales channel.</li>\r\n\t<li>A base royalty percentage.</li>\r\n\t<li>Variations to that percentage, based on the date of the sale, the price of the sale, and the cumulative sale quantity.</li>\r\n\t<li>Agreed advances, and whether they have actually been paid.</li>\r\n\t<li>The number of months since publication.</li>\r\n\t<li>The date for which the statement is generated in relation to the publication date.</li>\r\n\t<li>Any reserve against returns.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>This section gives an overview of the royalty and statement production capabilities of Bibliocloud.&nbsp;The major elements are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Storing the specification for the royalty calculation</li>\r\n\t<li>Storing the sales data</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, when calculating the amount to be paid to a contributor, the following other factors must be considered:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Reserve against returns</li>\r\n\t<li>Advance payments</li>\r\n\t<li>Prior royalty payments</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>CALCULATION BATCHES</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Royalty calculation batches are groups of products that are to be run through a royalty calculation cycle.&nbsp;Start by defining a new batch, supplying the name of the batch and optionally a last sales invoice date to consider.&nbsp;Edit the batch to add products to it.&nbsp;The analysis step, which can be skipped, provides information on the current data supporting each royalty calculation &ndash; the number of sales, the number of unroyaltied sales, the presence of royalty base rates for the edition, etc.&nbsp;The results of the royalty calculation can be reviewed before the batch is approved.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>STATEMENTS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Statement generation batches are groups of Contacts for which Financial Statements are to be generated.&nbsp;When creating a new batch the name must be unique, so it&rsquo;s generally best to be methodical about your naming convention.&nbsp;The date that you supply is fixed once the batch is created, but if you get it wrong it&rsquo;s easy to delete a batch and create a new one.&nbsp;When the batch has been created, edit it to add contacts and start the statement generation process.&nbsp;The results of the statement generation can be reviewed before the batch is approved.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>ADVANCES</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This page is a list of all the advances agreed.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>PAYMENTS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This page is a list of all the payments recorded as being made: both for advances and royalties.</p>\r\n\r\n"], [70, "Calendars", "<p>If you have used online calendars, such as Google Calendar, then you may be familiar with the idea of calendar subscriptions, whereby you add to your own events those of another person or organisation. Typically we use these to see lists of public holidays, or the schedules of co-workers, and as events are created or modified the changes appear in your own calendaring system.</p>\r\n<p>Your Bibliocloud system will contain a great many dates, such as all of the publication dates for an imprint, and allows you to subscribe to them in the standard format that your calendaring system will almost certainly accept. This allows you to view your upcoming publishing dates on your own calendar without having to type them in yourself. If you chose to subscribe to such a calendar then your calendaring system will periodically refresh itself based on the latest data within Bibliocloud, so if a publication date changes then the subscribers to the calendar will see that change.</p>\r\n<div class=\"bs-callout bs-callout-success\"><h4>ICALENDAR</h4>\r\n<p>The widely accepted format for calendar information is known as iCalendar. It allows the interchange of a series of different calendar-related information, such as events, to-do lists, and alarms. Bibliocloud currently supports only events, but may be expanded in the future to include more types of information.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Currently Bibliocloud allows you to subscribe to calendars for imprints and for schedules, and they are created in the imprint and schedule edit pages.</p>\r\n<p>In order to avoid filling your calendar with outdated events or with events which are too far in the future to be considered reliable, you can apply filters to the calendars to only include events within a particular window. The historical and future windows are expressed in number of days, weeks, months or years, and are calculated from the date at which a subscribing calendar system makes a request for fresh data. For example, if a calendar is defined with a window of 1 month of historical and 2 months of future events then when a calendar refreshes on 1st January 2018 the range of events included will be all of those between 1st December 2017 and 1st March 2018.</p>\r\n<p>When you have created a calendar you subscribe to it with its URL, which you can copy to your clipboard by clicking the &lsquo;Copy URL&rsquo; button. You can then paste the URL into the relevant area for subscribing to an iCalendar in your calendaring system.</p>\r\n<p>The calendaring system will probably ask you how frequently you would like the calendar to be refreshed, offering options such as &lsquo;Every minute&rsquo;, &lsquo;Every hour&rsquo;, &lsquo;Every six hours&rsquo;, &lsquo;Every day&rsquo; etc., and in general &lsquo;Every day&rsquo; is sufficient for calendars based on publication dates.</p>\r\n<p>It is important to note that there is no login or security check placed on calendar subscriptions. If you give someone the URL for a calendar then they can use it and see all of the calendars events. Of course this has the advantage that you can share the calendar with people who do not have a Bibliocloud license, but for whom the events might be useful. For example, if you use third-party sales representation then a calendar of your upcoming publication dates can be very useful to them.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n"], [80, "Finance", "<h4>Add a currency</h4>\r\n<p>Go to Main menu > Settings > ...for finance > Currencies > Add new.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Select the currency from the drop down list.
